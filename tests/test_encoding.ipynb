       "'we thought you weren t ever coming for this  sign there and there  you re not going to do anything silly with a gun are you maurice  mind you no one would blame you  if you purchase a shotgun you must keep it under lock and key  as stipulated on the licence  you understand  yes  thank you  what is your problem  they let me go the court let me go  come on  do you have any expectation of either allaying my unease  or getting started again today mr frant  if not i might usefully adjourn  and take my daughter to her new college for the start of her fresher term  it s with much personal regret that i should keep a father from such a duty my lord  there is a slight problem in the witness statements  if we could have a short adjournment i should be most grateful  customs excise have had 15 months to prepare this case  during that time the defendants have been in custody  i m a bit worried about the inconsistencies in your case  is an adjournment really going to do it for you  perhaps we could adjourn until the morning  if you re optimistic about getting the prosecution back on track and not stopping  as you point out my lord my clients have been on remand for 15 months  i wonder if you d consider releasing them on bail  i don t think so mr peters  until the morning  all rise  what a shambles  a pound says they come back tomorrow and throw it   and without any interference from you judge  what me interfere  the list officer called can you deal with a quick guilty plea   who s for the prosecution  michael willingham  well that won t be quick charlie hi hang on no  i don t think so  do you want to go down now we ve just adjourned  all right i ll pick you up shortly   my lord  if it s the guilty plea i can t do it  we need to get it out of the way my lord  your lordship isn t leaving the building   we re all minded of your security my lord  find my policeman  i ll have a pee  my lord  check the street   where s his lordship  i believe he went to the bathroom  you know full well he didn t he s left  i know no such thing mr radcliff  this is not the first time you ve connived with him mrs cooper  you d do well to know which side you re on  i m here to assist his lordship  you re here to help ensure he doesn t get up to any of his tricks  if you don t  the lord chancellor s department will quickly replace you  is that all you re taking what about your sound system  covered roommate s got hers  it s going to feel strange not having you around  i m only 30 minutes away dad  chas  rory   how you doing  hey   what did you do on your gap  saved belize  the government there is really trying to protect the rainforest now  great are they stopping the multinationals  we put sugar in the tractor fuel tanks  and hammered spikes to the trees to wreck the chainsaws   that s great  what did you do  i did something far more dangerous i worked in mcdonald s   oh have you given up being a veggie  it s a joke  mcdonald s would have been cooler i did legal stuff around the courts  this is the judge judge this is rory  we were at the cesspit together  that s what grandpa calls the comp  you two turned out nice enough  rory organised the at road widening protest  he stopped some major woodlands being destroyed  ah yes i read about that a lot of property got damaged  that s just police propaganda dad  i read about the murder case you tossed last week judge   did you get away with it  just about   you reading law  social anthropology  all those tutors have to eat i suppose  it s a joke  if we didn t study social anthropology we wouldn t know why we queue in supermarkets  it s a joke dad   adam s here and hamm  great  the judge knows all the best pubs in brighton  you re in early michael  or were you out all night  oh you re the one who was missed at the digs last night  the lord chancellor s people nearly sent out a search party  i refuse to become a judicial prisoner  the housekeeper almost wrestled me to the ground when i stepped out to post a letter  you ll get used to that overweening concerns   you okay  yeah  you sure  you know there was a time when i  when i couldn t wait to get into court  the law ordered things made things right ended chaos  nods in that direction  couldn t sleep last night  i ve got this wretched case starting this morning  you know the father who shot his daughter s killer  jo mills is for the defence  tough row to hoe  i don t relish sending him down for life   who s for the prosecution  stafford clark  oh he s a lazy slob  have them in let him plead to manslaughter on the basis of diminished responsibility  or provocation  well four months had elapsed between the two killings  it might be argued that mr haart had regained mental responsibility  a case could be made that he hadn t recovered from his daughter s death  the non custodial sentence her killer got threw him back  you still think like a defence barrister john  and there s some jiggery pokery from the lcd  they want an example to stop others  i d have shot him if he d run my daughter down and left her to die   now it looks like collusion  yes but the point is  mr frant   we re going to have to withdraw  why  mr frant   i d hoped this would ve ended  i m sorry my lord  the prosecution i regret my lord can offer no further evidence in this case  thank you for your candour  ladies and gentlemen of the jury the prosecution s case has collapsed  it but remains for me to invite you  to return a verdict of not guilty after the clerk of the court has read the charges  you can return the verdict without retiring  members of the jury  on the count of conspiring to illegally import cannabis  and upon his lordship s direction  do you find the defendants james everett and sean arnold not guilty  yes not guilty  is that the verdict of you all  well yes  i know it sounds daft but technically the defendants remain in your charge  until you reach a verdict  i don t suppose you wanted them to go home with you do you  or perhaps you do thank you  would you now go with the jury bailiff  i m afraid he might have another case for you  may i ask at this point that an order be made for costs  both defendants have suffered considerable hardship in the past 15 months on remand  i thought prisoners had widescreen tv and open access to the net while on remand   i was thinking of financial hardship my lord  yes yes all right  that isn t to say i believe the defendants to be wholly innocent  i will ask the taxing master to look very closely at the costs involved  meanwhile  i suggest customs excise take radical measures to improve their act  thank you  all rise  i didn t engineer that collapse a pound please  well why did mr frant allow the case to go forward in the first place  he s a wing and a prayer merchant  i ve no doubt those two were importing cannabis  customs excise take a slip shod approach and then expect the judges to support them  and too many do  we ll see them back with that one before long  mr justice nivan has had a heart attack   is it bad  not life threatening  his murder case is coming your way you re the next senior red judge  he was a bit worried by it  the listing officer is trying not to send it here  i shouldn t be telling you this judge  michael nivan said there was some jiggery pokery  i m looking for my next piece of work  there s a rape case that needs a senior your lordship  where s the haart murder case mr justice nivan was to hear  well that would have been perfect for us but it s not quite ready  i understood from michael nivan that it was  i m not sure the presiding judge thought it quite ready your lordship  the rape case is very tricky my lord  the senior circuit judge can do the murder he has a ticket  but it makes no sense for a purple to do the murder and me do the rape  i ll send my clerk down for the papers  i d better speak to the lord chancellor s department   simon dymock  simon  it s willy radcliff  we have a possible problem at highfield  mr justice nivan s been taken ill  and mr justice deed is trying to lasso the haart murder case  the government doesn t want a spate of revenge killings  an example needs to be made of the father and deed can t be relied on for that  and will you order him not to try the case sir  unfortunately willy no one can order a high court judge  not me not the permanent secretary not even the lord chancellor  well the tabloids are calling for justice for the father  whipping up the black community  we already have a protest outside the court  find deed something else if not lose the papers for a while  who s in charge here  you cannot conduct your protest here silent or otherwise  i must ask you to move across the street  there s been a slight change rita  his lordship has drawn the most interesting case   he s expecting the haart papers  he s got the rape case i m afraid  do they think they re putting one over me  if i m not speaking out of turn judge  the clerk of number two court has got a direct line to the lcd  check the jury panel s assembled and send those back  jo  gosh john i ve never seen a red judge in his braces you re risking gossip  they won t even let me get my own coffee   that s elevation for you  you ready to start the haart case  not with you trying it  be in number two in five minutes  ready to go  what s the problem   it feels like a breath of fresh air  tornado more like  he interferes all the time makes you look incompetent  i ll i ll call you later   dodged your minders did you  i m getting good at it  is the prosecution ready to begin the haart case  word is they ve bounced you  yeah just as soon as i find my junior she went for a pee about an hour ago  where are the papers for the haart case   he s here now looking for the pages  do i look stupid to you   we have the rape case my lord  who is he talking to  put him on let me speak to him  simon dymock circuit administrator   no time i ve got a trial to start  did you hear that  don t let him make him take the rape  the lennox rape case really does need someone of your superior intellect your lordship  the haart case begins in number two in 10 minutes with or without the papers  all rise  this case was to have been heard by the presiding judge mr justice nivan  unfortunately he s been taken ill  as the papers have yet to reach me  i shall require the case to be fully opened by the prosecution  members of the jury the defendant maurice haart  is charged on this indictment with murder  in that he on the 27th of february murdered alex redburn  to this indictment he has pleaded not guilty  it is your task to say whether he is guilty or not  you may sit down  i would if i may bring to your lordship s attention  the demonstration currently going on outside the court  doubtless with the sole purpose of influencing the jury  hasn t gone unnoted mr stafford clark  nor the fact that we ve just heard the jury swear to try the case according to the evidence alone  members of the jury counsel for the prosecution is right  in pointing out to the court the small demonstration taking place outside  it suggests a racial motivation for this case  i must caution you  not to speak to anyone on that demonstration about this case  or to accept any of their literature during the course of this trial  before i proceed with the openings i d like to see counsel in my chambers  this is an administrative matter  i d normally let you slope off for a cup of coffee  but as this will only take a few moments would you stay where you are please  thank you  all rise  you know what i m going to ask  the majority of the country if the tabloids are to be believed  is hostile to the whole idea of this man standing trial for murder  worse his going to prison on a mandatory life sentence  now i m not saying that i agree with them but i must consider public opinion  we have to decide how justice can best be served here  michael nivan was worried about proceeding with the murder charge  if a plea of manslaughter were to be accepted  i d be minded to impose a suspended sentence  personally i d love to go that way  i did discuss it with the cps but they re adamant  well far be it for me to try to influence the prosecuting authorities  but they are in danger of finding themselves in a no win situation aren t they  a conviction would be very unpopular  an acquittal will make them seem vindictive in charging him with murder in the first place  yeah well i doubt if they see it like that  well you re running the case david  would haart plead to manslaughter if david were persuaded  i have a client problem my lord   he doesn t care whether he wins or loses in court  oh   jury defence statement  oh yes   redburn got what he deserved  right  the task before the prosecution is straightforward  to show beyond reasonable doubt  a that the prisoner  carried out the actions that killed the deceased mr redburn  and b that when he did this  he did it with the intention of killing or seriously injuring him  now we will show beyond shadow of doubt that the defendant prior to february the 27th  observed and stalked his victim alex redburn with the clear intention of killing him  in revenge for the tragic accident some four months previously  when he ran over and killed mr haart s daughter  what followed was a premeditated act of murder  your name will be mud my lord  oh give it a rest jo it s bad enough that i have to have minders  there s even a chaplain available for me  he could improve your character  so how are you going to run provocation  stafford clark s looking to block all avenues  no one can imagine the overwhelming sense of loss this father feels  he had to relive the whole shock when redburn walked  you re on shaky ground he had four weeks to think about it before acting  time has stopped for this father  get him to plead to manslaughter  i ll give him a non custodial sentence  any sentence is meaningless john  living is his sentence  well it s for the prosecution to disprove provocation if you decide to run it  i hope you ve got some good external witnesses  you fancy your chances   is she a good lawyer  she would get better under your tutelage   would you like to have dinner  am i the consolation prize  is that how you see yourself jo  i m surprised  it s quite hard to maintain a positive image  we could go back to my place  what your official lodgings  it d go straight back to the lord chancellor  oh we could lose laurel and hardy  no i gotta get back to tom won t do his homework unless i m there  would save me making a fool of myself  thought that s what your minders were for   hey how s charlie  she s great  her mother and grandfather are still not talking to her  for choosing sussex over oxford  you re lucky she didn t choose york i sometimes wonder if i ll ever see marc again  i ll introduce you then you re on your own  talk to your client get him to plead  this is john deed jane  run  get back  i can run provocation  that is your only possible defence  for that the jury has to be convinced that a reasonable man like you  may have been provoked by something that was said or done  but even that only reduces murder to manslaughter  it doesn t matter what the judge or the jury do  i m guilty mrs mills  a lot of people up and down the country think otherwise  you re risking a mandatory life sentence maurice  the court that tried redburn made a mockery of my little girl s short life  what more can they do to me  we ll find something  i saw him that day  redburn  driving his lorry  the same lorry that killed my mona  the day you shot him why didn t you tell me this before  provocation will run very well  we ll put you in the witness box you tell the jury exactly what you just told me  no   he s about to start mrs mills  it ll keep  well we can t possibly continue with this case until i have the information i asked for last week  could you get it for me please no not now  excuse me madam  might i have a word  might be better in private  any secrets you know my colleagues will know soon enough bob  your daughter phoned madam  gosh do i still have a daughter  she was phoning from a police station madam she s been arrested and needs a surety for bail  sounds like she needs a criminal lawyer   didn t she call her father  he s in court madam  oh i see  his career is still coming first  well i ve got clients coming in   it ll do charlie no harm to cool her heels  i daresay madam  she can try her father or sweat it out  aren t you curious george  oh i know what it ll be about her latest latest protest  charlie wants to save the world  you stated in evidence what mr haart s actions were  when he handed you the shotgun  what was his outward appearance  so that we might help the jury understand his state of mind  he was calm i d say  very calm  for someone who had just shot somebody he was miss  would you say his manner was that of someone in shock  he was still and quiet like shock victims completely out of it  was he completely out of it when he came to the station with the gun  he was like a piece of putty  you ve known mr haart since the death of his daughter  it was me who broke the news to him   how would you describe his state then  his world fell apart  he kept saying how she was only doing the paper round  to save up to see her nan in jamaica how he shouldn t have let her  and when you saw him subsequently had his state changed  hardly at all  at one time we thought he might be planning to kill himself  did you take any action on that  i asked the police surgeon to see him he referred him to a psychiatrist  did you observe the defendant at the trial of the man who killed his daughter  every day just sitting not saying a word  a couple of times i offered him tea it was like he didn t see me  on each of your subsequent meetings sergeant would it be fair to say that he was out of it   glazed like a man in shock  no doubt about it  thank you sergeant  before you step away sergeant  can you tell the court how you dealt with the defendant s application for a shotgun licence  it was processed in the normal way  you thought these circumstances were normal  they weren t considered abnormal my lord  well the man s daughter had been killed by a hit and run driver  did it not occur to you that there might be criminal intent in the application  no my lord  the applicant was of good character has no criminal record  well from your description of him the applicant might have been suicidal  there are easier ways to kill yourself my lord  did it occur to you that he might want the gun to kill the man who killed his daughter  no sir  he applied for the licence before the trial of alex redburn  it was assumed redburn would be sent to prison  and the application takes what 10 weeks to be approved  so it arrived after the trial  four weeks and one day  after the non custodial sentence was given to redburn  are you calling the gunsmith mr stafford clark  no my lord the defence accepts his statement  this can be read to the jury  so the shooting occurred  on the same day as the licence was collected  and the gun was purchased yes  did you encourage the defendant in his action   no my lord not at all  no word or gesture  i mean the police do sometimes encourage victims to duff someone up  not in my experience my lord  hmm  do you want to come back at all mr stafford clark  thank you my lord  sergeant do you have any special expertise for assessing people in shock  no sir  well just so the jury is clear about this  your evidence as to the prisoner s mental state was opinion   yes sir  thank you sergeant  how long have you been a policeman  19 years my lord  yes in all that time you must have accrued a wealth of experience  i m sure the jury can accept that you re an expert thank you you can step down   yeah  daddy it s george   did charlie call  i ve not heard a squeak out of her  she is in a spot of bother with the police  another of her protests i expect  do you want me to send my driver down and try to sort it out  that s very sweet let her call her father  must go oh by the way do you remember gec and aeu  hm i ought to i gave the ruling  it s about to make me a lot of mun  here turn it off will you   which police station  the high street  have the press got it  i don t think so judge or the lcd press office would have been on  i assumed you didn t want your driver  why the hell her mother couldn t have gone   john could i have a word  i have to run   i need to speak to you off the record  go on then  i appreciate your dilemma jo but there s nothing i can do  you ve got an answer to most other things  you can t tell the jury what provoked haart and neither can i  so unless you get him into the witness box you re stuffed  i m sorry jo  we ve been working very very hard on your behalf  thank you mr wheldon  although i think we might want more than tea  i thought it was gonna be good news  it s not good news mike it s very good news  under the employment contracts  drafted by the lawyers to the old union before it amalgamated  you won t have to pay one cent in back pensions for the closure of business  do i take it that the whole 15 million is safe   15 620 000 at closure  plus 29 months interest at 7 4  the contract was poorly drafted  the union lawyers in those days were too keen to score political points  rather than looking at the detail  he said when we took over that company they knew our intentions  so passed on their obligations  there s been quite a bit of case law since margaret thatcher trounced the unions  surely the court would want us to honour the intention  it ll look at the yawning gap between intention and drafting and find in your favour  fantastic  that s it free  if you don t turn up for your court appearance i go to jail  you couldn t do something else for me dad  rory can t find a surety   i hardly know him charlie  he s one of the good guys  he can t stay here it s not fair  okay just make sure he gets to court  mr justice deed   it doesn t end here dad  not with that reporter onto it  i ll talk to the press office let them handle it  i did try and get the ice maiden to come  college is pretty hacked off with us  they should be glad to have students who care about something  they own the farm we trashed   not a smart move  it s dirty agriculture   why should they be immune  they could boot you out   you could talk to the vice chancellor  no  i got a pile of work on charlie this is where i draw the line  the board could send them down  these are young people who care colin  we re all too in the thrall of commercial interests these days  sometimes direct action is the only way  it might help charlie s case if she were persuaded to move back to law   she s got a lawyer s mind  you didn t tell me you had moved   three days in to marine biology  why  i think the lecturer might have something to do with it   good looking 30 lives life to the full  come off it   charlie  i m trying to help  the law is so boring dad  it s wonderful when you get it right for someone you soar  that s you dad  i ve got too many of the ice maiden and grandpa s genes   you could get sent down  for trashing the wheat or changing my course  the sea is where we all came from if we can t keep that alive the whole planet s doomed   you need the law to protect the environment  it s done precious little so far  but it s not the law that s the problem it s the people who interpret it  keep your head down tell rory to  within five years 90 of wheat will be genetically modified  trashing a few fields is hardly going to change anything  it s time to raise the ante what do you say   we d better not get caught next time  we won t  police get dressed  haart out haart out haart out  when you saw the prisoner prior to countersigning his gun application  how did he appear to you  he was rational in control  certainly someone we deemed responsible enough to own a gun  nothing about mr haart s manner alerted you to an underlying problem  that s correct madam  how many times had you met mr haart prior to the interview for the gun licence  i hadn t i knew who he was of course  well never having seen him before how would you know if his behaviour was abnormal to him  well i m sure sergeant bridges would have said  sergeant bridges said he was like a man beside himself completely out of it  thank you inspector that s all  inspector how many applications for a gun licence have you dealt with  from people in mr haart s circumstances  people who ve had a daughter killed none my lord  well didn t his application prompt you to examine his motives further  it did my lord i ran a psychological profile  he came out with a high score for rational responsible behaviour  and what are your qualifications for psychological profiling  i have a degree in psychology from leeds university  haart out haart out haart out  how is the media responding to mr justice deed s daughter on the gmos protest  what we re getting is generally sympathetic dad is seen as caring and concerned  that s a pity  find an aggressive investigative journalist  there s something more to this story i m sure of it  hi  do you want to come back to the digs for an indigestible lunch  the police have arrested rory  they lifted him in the middle of the night like a terror squad  come on even i don t believe they re that bad  you ve never been arrested we can t even find where they ve taken him  coop tell them we won t come back for toenail pie  get us some sandwiches instead will you   why was he lifted  don t you watch the news  a warehouse of gm wheat got burnt the night before last  charlie that s not trashing a field  2 000 000 worth of damage was done  he s innocent completely entirely totally  there s no such person  you ve got to help him  i can recommend a good lawyer   you can talk to your friend at scotland yard  i thought you said he was innocent  your policeman friend could impress that fact upon those dolts in sussex  yes good one good one  yes  you should let me win occasionally john   it d be good for my ego  what about my ego row   you must be in here every day  laurel and hardy say it s too risky  all you have to do is walk down from the seventh floor at lunchtime  that s risky for a heterosexual male even a deputy assistant commissioner  this place is full of gay policemen at lunchtime  perhaps we should start betting  if the stakes were high enough i d risk the gays  how s that murder case going  if there was ever a man who should never have been put in the dock it s that father  videotape evidence will convict him  unless the defence pulls something out of the bag  well if i was the arresting officer there wouldn t have been any taped evidence  policemen nowadays can t think for themselves  but that s not what you wanted to talk to me about  are you taking me to the ivy or stringfellows   it s your turn to take me row  not for the sort of help you want  why are you getting involved john it s risky  if you d collected a daughter or two from all those wives you had you wouldn t have to ask   is charlie involved  no of course not  the boy is just a friend  then why put yourself on offer for someone you hardly know  it s no longer easy to intervene not even for a senior policeman  charlie thinks this boy is going to be someone  you still like to mark out future players  did i wake you   yeah it was a late night row  lucky you  stay clear of rory brown tell charlie too  he s a bad lot he s being held under the prevention of terrorism act   is the evidence against him sound  it s sound  you asked me john i ve told you  make your own choices  okay thanks row gotta go   could i stay and take a bath judge  why not staff will call you a taxi  they ve probably already reported your visit to the lord chancellor s office  i don t care what your policeman friend says rory wasn t there  you had me ask him the question  you can t change the reality of the situation because you don t like the answer   that s what your friend is doing  listen  people are putting themselves at risk for you and that idiot  he didn t burn down that warehouse  i know with absolute certainty he didn t  i don t know anything with absolute certainty   and i send people down for life  rory was with me all night  well just make sure you re practising safe sex  we re not sleeping together  tell the police about it charlie   tell them he was with you they ll believe you  oh sure  what about all this strong evidence your friend claims they have  well if you weren t in bed how were you so certain he didn t burn down the warehouse  because we were breaking into a laboratory where they do work for the biotech companies  oh charlie charlie what are you telling me  we were 90 miles away trashing database for thousands of genetically modified  we re talking serious crime here i m a high court judge   i have a duty to report criminal activities  those companies are the criminals  they don t know what s going to happen when they release this genetically modified crap   then find another way to change things  these people own the government  yes and your lot owns public opinion  getting a criminal record and ruining your future isn t going to achieve anything   who cares about my future  i do  i care very much  stay  woof woof  my lord it s for your own protection  i m meeting a senior policeman  how are you gonna keep me any safer than he does  why did you take the job if you don t like the trappings  so that i can take the 300 drop in salary  you better tell me all you know   this rory brown problem s not going to go away  i ve told you too much already   just how involved is charlie  charlie s not involved   the sussex police think that she might be  they re way off beam burn everything  my advice is to stay clear  for your sake and charlie s rory brown s a dope fiend  who gets himself out of trouble by putting others in the frame   did you hear what they talked about  he told me not to come into the gym   i thought you were supposed to stay close  i d have had to fight him sir  a friend at the yard told me  deputy assistant commissioner colemore is making inquiries  after one of the protestors arrested with his lordship s daughter   rory brown  excellent stephen  let me drop you  it s only a question of time before you tell us what we want to know  i didn t burn that warehouse i wasn t there   we have an informant who says you were  i wish i had been  how involved is mr justice deed s daughter  it doesn t matter about you  what i m going to do is offer you a very simple way of getting out of this   is it all right to talk dad  depends what you say my darling   rory s back  good  i don t know he s sort of changed he wants to talk to you   what s this about charlie  he wouldn t say he just said it was important  will you see him  okay have him call this number  it s straightforward enough judge  that sounds like blackmail rory brown  i m just pointing out sir if i go down charlie goes too  the only alibi i ve got for the warehouse burning is breaking into the laboratory  charlie was there  yes i ve two more witnesses to call for the prosecution my lord  but i m wondering in view of the hour if this might not be a convenient moment  yes that would be sensible thank you  all rise  shall i take your wig my lord  is there anything i can do  i can t let charlie go down the tubes without doing something  but there are inevitable consequences  well i could keep an eye on the list see who gets the young man s case  you could maybe have a word with the judge   is that how it works coop  so i believe my lord  judge i ve told you before i prefer judge  well you ll have to be very careful  if willy radcliff gets a whiff of it it ll go straight back to the lcd  i still have friends among the poles  people of low esteem that s what some of the circuit judges call us   mrs mills judge  what can i do for you jo  i just wanted to see how you are you hardly interrupted all day   you don t like me interrupting  what s wrong  nothing  you are the only judge i ve ever known to show any real feeling  it s charlie isn t it   let s get a drink  what about laurel and hardy  coop send my driver on an errand will you  i ll go to the loo and lose my policemen  shut up and listen john   i understand you wanna get involved  do you think i ve been stupid  very   you ve spoken to row colemore  he s a friend  charlie thought rory brown was a friend  this assumes that i ll remain on the bench  i ll help my daughter and her friend and then resign   you might not be afforded that luxury  i intend to help any way i can  just remind the jury how the defendant said he d like to kill mr redburn  as violently as possible  when he was in your opinion calm and rational dr dundas  yes he was  isn t such a threat a fairly normal reaction from an angry grieving father   i have seen it before in grieving parents  anger in grief is fairly common is it  very common my lord  is it possible doctor that in this state a man might be provoked into a violent reaction   triggered by some later less serious incident  it is possible  there is casework on this   are you citing authority mrs mills  i will be doing so my lord   you want to come back mr stafford clark  no my lord  thank you dr dundas  that was my last witness and concludes the case for the prosecution my lord  then i m sure the jury will enjoy an early day  i remind you not to discuss this case other than among yourselves when gathered all together  thank you till the morning  all rise  none of this would have happened had she gone to oxford   which is where she belongs  i wouldn t bet on it knowing charlie   she needs a firmer hand  well you could well be right joe  but neither one of us wants to lay that on her  here you go   my lord  if you want me to help with this mess  charlotte must agree to read law at brasenose   i ve spoken to the college  you re getting simple minded joe  you should spend some more time with her instead of being hacked off with her  at spending so much time with her very common father  charlie will exercise choice to her last breath   her choice  look where it got her on police bail  i d hoped you d respond like a grandfather  i don t enjoy seeing my granddaughter out of control  she is a warm responsive human being she is not out of control  then why is some wretched journalist trying to contact me at home  concerning her relationship with someone called rory brown  charlie thinks those companies are a bunch of criminals she s probably right  breaking the law is not the way to check them  joe she s 19 years old she wants to change the world   didn t you ever want to do that  emotional rubbish  you ve involved the deputy assistant commissioner  and now you re trying to involve me  how do you know about row colemore  nothing much escapes the lord chancellor s people  think about my offer  i don t need to for one second no deal  i shall have to report what you re asking to the proper authority  of course you re an emotional cripple  you could never exercise judgement where feelings were involved  i don t understand your florid language   i suspect it s to disguise your hypocrisy  my hypocrisy  you tried to gain the moral high ground while perverting the course of justice   we re talking about the future of my daughter  it was obvious from the start  that yours was a career that would end ignominiously  it s less a question of what you know than where you come from  well you were always well connected joe  that s what stopped your bad judgements being overturned  you re a time server a bench polisher  you ll never make a law lord you re just not sharp enough  get out before i do something i might regret  what s this a spark of emotion  you do your worst i won t let charlie suffer  you look tired is anything the matter   derek was bad again over the weekend  has he been to see a doctor yet  he s scared of what they ll find  my ex father in law s sister s saying he s got a problem with his prostate and one of his testicles  and he could have had them both sorted out when he was derek s age  i ll make him go  the rapist from three weeks ago is back for sentence   okay let s get that in before haart resumes  they re all ready judge   any sign of the boy s case yet  my spies are still looking out  all rise  haart out haart out haart out haart out  step aside quick   this trial is a racist sham  yeah right on brother  unlucky wrong trial  your timing is as ill judged as your convictions  i can t think that a narrow cell is more inviting than the pavement  you can watch from the gallery and check if we re being racist  but if you interrupt you go down the steps  take him out  before the jury returns am i going to hear a submission from you mrs mills  yes my lord no case to answer  the prosecution has conspicuously failed to establish in evidence  that mr haart was other than provoked in the action he took  even though a certain time had elapsed  during which one might assume that reason had resumed its seat  they had failed to realise that as in the queen and mary loman  that provocation can be delayed by up to two years in grief and anger  and triggered by a lesser provocation  yes i m familiar with the authority i was the defending barrister  however it goes more to your defence than your submission  i assume you will be submitting evidence as to what triggered the provocation after the delay  and i look forward to it but i m afraid i m against you here  let s have the jury back in   i call dr eugene baldichino  do i understand you re not calling your client  no my lord  well i m obliged to warn you of the inference that might be drawn from the silence   have you explained this to the defendant  yes my lord  would a short adjournment be of assistance to you   i am obliged my lord  very well  shall we say 20 minutes  it s a real risk  your best chance is to tell the jury exactly what provoked you  i m sure they ll respond in the way that we want them to  that won t bring back mona mrs mills  i know you re trying your best  but nothing really matters anymore  mona was his life he was always talking about her  her achievements  next most important thing was his work at the hospice  following mona s death he only seemed to function on automatic pilot  it is possible he had delayed some big emotional response to his daughter s death  awaiting the right or wrong sort of provocation to trigger it  yes  can you explain that  mr haart was constantly dealing with intensely emotional situations  like other hospice staff working with the dying he learnt to block against his emotions  do those blocked emotions ever emerge  yes at inappropriate times  you can t shut that emotional response off forever   yes but in what circumstances  my lord may i examine my own witness  i m obliged my lord  dr baldichino can you describe mr haart s response  when the man who killed his daughter was sentenced  he went inward as he did to the news of his daughter s death   did you think that was the end of it  no  mr haart went deep into depression  for this reason i spent as much time as possible with him  i feared that one day all this anger would surface  in the most inappropriate manner when the provocation reminded him of mona s death   yes  and in this state he d   function on automatic often not aware of what he was doing  yes familiar actions are performed without emotional connection  would he be aware of the consequences of his actions  for example if he put a patient in a scalding bath he d burn  turn off her oxygen she d die  yes of course  are we to assume that he would have been aware of his intentions  in stalking the man responsible for his daughter s death with a shotgun  my lord i may have missed something but  the defendant collected the licence and purchased the shotgun  the same day that mr redburn died  i don t recall evidence of the defendant stalking the deceased man with a shotgun  the prosecution s case is that mr haart applied for the licence and bought the shotgun  with the intention of killing mr redburn  if that proves to be so then stalking s not unreasonable  even if it is slightly emotive language mr stafford clark  well then can we assume that in the clinical state you describe  he d have known what he was doing when going after mr redburn   but of course  thank you doctor  mrs mills  despite being aware of what he was doing doctor  would mr haart have been able to stop himself reacting to a provocation  what sort of provocation are you suggesting mrs mills  well for example my lord  if mr haart saw the deceased doing what he was doing when he ran his daughter over  driving his lorry in a dangerous and illegal manner  well are you offering in evidence that the defendant saw  mr redburn driving his lorry illegally and dangerously before he was killed   my lord i must object to this hypothesis  no no i will let the witness answer  it goes to helping the jury understand the nature of provocation  but keep in mind the defence hasn t offered this in evidence  put the question again  despite being aware of what he was doing doctor  would mr haart have been able to stop himself reacting to such provocation   no no no my lord i really  it s arguable that he was provoked  you can answer the question  it would almost certainly have been spontaneous unstoppable action   in the face of such provocation by mr redburn  thank you dr baldichino  before you step away doctor can you tell us why the response is provoked later  and not at the obvious time of the child s death  it s like a head of steam in a kettle  for so long the lid holds it down the provocation could be major or minor during this period  the strength of the emotions being held down determines when it will blow  despite his suffering was mr haart able to reason   i would have to say yes  thank you doctor  why do you have to interfere so much  what are you trying to do punish me for not sleeping with you  i know we have a social relationship but i am still his lordship mrs mills  oh you must be the most infuriating man to be married to  coop would you be an angel and get mrs mills a soothing cup of tea   i m trying to get at the truth  don t patronise me you undermined us  provocation won t run after that time lapse   the prosecution was giving me a free ride  i have to be seen to be fair  that creep of a clerk talks to the lcd every five minutes  since when do you care what they think  i ll be less effective if the permanent secretary hauls me in  god forbid that should happen  get me a drink  and i wasn t a complete pain to live with you should try it one weekend  i don t believe anyone lasts a whole weekend  you didn t get haart to testify  i can t manhandle him  if i put him in the witness box  he ll say he shot redburn and redburn got what he deserved  i d have done the same in his shoes  well we ll just have to get him to tell his story without going into the witness box won t we  would you like to have dinner  sorry too much work  fascinated to learn that deed made an approach to a lord justice of appeal joseph  the man has no background simon  it s a wonderful lever he s given us  trying to pervert the course of justice goes way beyond a slap from the permanent secretary   i ll throw deed to my investigative journo  well don t forget that i am involved  you correctly reported it to a senior law officer in the lord chancellor s department   i do want to help my granddaughter  fine  but we will have deed s resignation at the end of it  mrs channing my lord  what would the tabloid headlines be   hanging judge hooked on cowboy films   justice was straightforward in those days  it was totally barbaric  do you want some takeaway it s the only way i can survive the digs food  is there anyone here john   only the servants  i meant anyone intimate   would it matter  daddy seems to think so  i was reluctant to come here too many spies  so i hear  daddy s taken action  does that make any sense  there s no longer a prima facie case against the boy   the prosecution will fall at committal  my god   the old man found some guts  would you please tell me what s going on  you re looking very good george   yes well i made a lot of money this week  it suits you  just because they re corporate clients doesn t mean that they can t sometimes be right  well at that level business is always exploiting somebody   what about providing jobs  oh yes providing jobs of course  oh god  you re so superior   what  you re very sexy when you re angry george  it doesn t work  not anymore john  just what is it they re up to  daddy was being as secretive as john  a friendly journalist told me charlie is somehow involved  with the boy whose case has fallen  god i hate being shut out of anything  i ll find out all i can  don t keep me in suspense it s good news isn t it it is good news  the warehouse burning charge is gone  thank you  i can t pretend i m sanguine about breaking into the lab   were others involved besides rory  there were eight of us  you see there s the weakness  most common or garden crims are caught by people informing on them  they re all committed eco warriors  faced with going to prison any one of them might sell you out   your friend rory for a start  no he wouldn t  he s done it before chas  that s stupid i don t believe you who said so  it wasn t for rory s sake that rory was pulled clear  it was to stop him from selling you out   come on i ll buy you dinner  i can t dad i m meeting someone  be careful who you get involved with in direct action  i can t pull this trick again chas  when you come to consider your verdict ladies and gentlemen  i want you to keep to the forefront of your minds  the three most salient facts that we heard in evidence  the prisoner applied for a shotgun licence before alex redburn was sentenced  he didn t snatch up a gun and rush to this man s house  the moment he heard of the tragedy  four months elapsed between the death of his daughter  and mr redburn getting sentenced and his subsequently being shot  four months  for the defendant to plot and plan this execution  and then calmly confess to his deed  now let s examine the third point  the videotaped confession  to remind ourselves exactly how calm he was at this time  i went to his house and waited for him to come home  when he arrived  i followed him along the path and shot him  why did you shoot him maurice  why now  there was no plot there was no plan  mr haart was provoked when he shot mr redburn  i invite you to consider how mr haart was a different man after his daughter s death  a man with the lid down waiting to explode at the right provocation  some saw the very lenient way his daughter s killer was dealt with by the court  as provocation  but he suppressed that as the psychiatrist explained  and the pressure continued to build  maurice haart did not plan to kill alex redburn  he was provoked into doing so  as clearly as if mr redburn had goaded him directly over the death of his daughter  here was a man whose very life stopped with the death of his child  and knowing as we do how he felt about mona  and knowing how we feel about our own children or grandchildren  ask yourselves if what he did  isn t something you might have done in his shoes  in arriving at a just and proper verdict  what you have to consider is whether maurice haart shot and killed alex redburn  if you accept that he did in fact do the killing what you then have to consider  is whether he did so deliberately  and with the intention of causing his death or of causing him serious injury  the prosecution say that he did  they say that he planned the whole thing  and that he executed that plan in cold blood  they remind you of the delay involved  but the defence has raised provocation  now provocation means  doing or saying something which causes a person to temporarily lose his reason  something which would cause a reasonable man  of mr haart s age and character to do likewise  dr baldichino says  mr haart s frustration was building like a head of steam in a kettle  and that provocation in this clinically depressed man  might not bear any time relation to the original act  now you ve heard a lot of evidence and a good many submissions  the only person who truly knows whether there was a trigger  is the defendant you may think  you have not heard from him  now if you find that the defendant killed mr redburn with the necessary intent  then you must be sure that he did so without provocation  this is a very important decision while sentence is for me  it s pointless pretending that you don t know what the sentence is for murder   manslaughter for a pound  i wouldn t take your money  coop could you rustle up some coffee and sandwiches please   not for me i ll eat his  you could be in trouble  the woman who runs pr at the lord chancellor s office  has been asking awkward questions  is she getting anywhere  she s got a bent policeman to search the police national computer  to check what moves i made around that warehouse burning  she s asking if you re involved in a cover up  and what am i supposed to be covering up  that s what she s trying to find out she could be in trouble as well  conspiring with a police officer to illegally enter the police computer  we can get her on that  if i knew what i was steering anyone away from  i could steer them away from it  yeah  jury are coming back in your lordship  if you consider the defendant may have been provoked in the way that i explained to you  then the correct verdict would be not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter  does that answer your question  all right off you go  thank you sir  let s take another vote around the table  what s the point why don t we let him go   because he did it  wouldn t you  it doesn t matter what she or anyone else would do in his shoes  course it does that s the whole point it s what any reasonable person would have done  not weeks and weeks after the event  he was provoked  it just took a long time to pop  we don t know if there was a trigger  you know what happens if we can t agree   they ll declare a mistrial  wrong  we get to go home tonight and then we come back and argue like this again tomorrow  and the day after that  well i don t want to come back tomorrow i ll go along with you  guilty   but you thought he was rightly provoked  i ve got a business to run   you can t change like that  yes he can  he has to weigh the evidence not change because of his business  take a vote on it  show of hands for guilty  we ve got 10 2 majority that ll do  we re there at last we can live with 10 2  we can t not unless the judge so directs us  well let s go and get his direction then  those who say he s not guilty  what re you doing put your hand down  i ve changed me mind now it s 9 3   you can t do that  you did  let s go through the evidence again  i ll have a word sir i ll be right there  mrs mills might i have a word  his lordship might not be sitting much longer  so i wouldn t get too close   why are you saying this all rise  are you likely to reach a verdict in the imminent future say before 4 30  i don t think so my lord  very well  then i m going to send you home for the night  so you can continue discussing this most important matter tomorrow  you are charged not to discuss this case  other than with fellow jurors when gathered all together  you will report back to the jury room by 10 a m tomorrow  all rise  haart out haart out haart out haart out  simon willy radcliff  we have a potential problem  a juror s been seen talking to and taking literature from a protestor  have you alerted his lordship you d better tell him straightaway  we could go for a retrial and still give it to the senior circuit judge  deed would kick up a stink if we show our hand  how do you read the jury  unreliable  in that case we might have to force deed s hand  let me know what he says willy  we have a problem my lord  the usher has seen a juror talking to a protester  is the usher sure it was a juror  yes of course  well there s nothing to be done tonight   will you deal with it in court my lord  yes  in camera i think  i m given to understand that despite my explicit directions not to do so  one of you has had contact with one of the protesters outside  do you need to be named or will the person who did so stand up  what do you have to say for yourself mr reid  i wanted some more information my lord  i wanted to ask them why they think the trial is racist  do you realise i could send you to prison for what you did  i could discharge the jury and then we d have to start all over again  it s hardly fair to the defendant or the taxpayer who would have to foot the bill   are you a taxpayer mr reid  yes my lord i own a small printing works  well i don t doubt that your presence on the jury is difficult  i don t doubt that you want to get back to your print works  well i m not going to send you to prison  i m not even going to stand you down and continue with 11 jurors  unless either counsel has any reasonable objection  i m going to insist that you do your duty  and trust to your honour that you weren t influenced   my lord  i think we ve dealt with this  in a proper adult way mr stafford clark   well i guess  if you have no objections mrs mills  i think we ll continue  my lord might we have a discussion in your room  do you have right of audience in this court  no i thought not  this court is no longer in camera  the jury will resume its deliberation  all rise  so what makes you think dymock has anything on you  he s hanging around here  i ve been stupid for my daughter  that s what fathers are for john  i mean that s why maurice haart is facing life in prison  pleading provocation isn t gonna help me jo  i m sure he s got less than you think  he s not the type to keep quiet  well i m assuming he can t afford to start all over again because the trial judge is disgraced  do one last thing for your client jo  if the jury comes back guilty which i m sure they will  get him to make a statement from the dock  oh what s the point  there s only one sentence if it s guilty  i m sure he ll want to tell his story  i ve got a dreary official dinner  ah my lord  on reflection i think you made a wise decision this morning  how s your lovely daughter  keeping her out of trouble are we  we re certainly trying simon  oh this is ishbel mcdonald  she handles pr for the lord chancellor s department  she has something for you  that is being offered to the guardian for publication tomorrow  it deals with how you conspired to help your daughter  and rory brown avoid arson charges when they burned a warehouse of gm crops  you might like to consider resignation as an alternative my lord  if you go to press you ll be arrested  you conspired with a police officer and illegally entered the police computer  now you might not go to prison for this offence but your career will be finished  yours too when she tells who put her up to it  be careful how you dispose of that  excuse me my lord  there s a phone call it s your daughter  tell her i ll call back  he ll call you back  what was that about is it difficult to talk  too many extensions on the house phones  are you managing to stay out of trouble  i m trying it s difficult  well remember what i told you darling your friend could be dangerous  i couldn t bear the thought of anything happening to you  i ve decided to cool it  i mean it wouldn t do to have a record  if i were to switch back to law  have you reached a verdict upon which at least 10 of you have agreed  we have  how do you find the defendant maurice haart on the count of murder  guilty or not guilty  guilty  was that the verdict of you all or by a majority  it was a majority  how many agreed and how many disagreed  ten agreed and two disagreed  very well  just stay in your seats will you please  throughout this trial  you have chosen to remain silent mr haart  often inferences are drawn as to that silence  rightly or wrongly  you have been found guilty of murder there is only one sentence  before passing it  is there anything you would like to say to this court  i m sorry  for the trouble i ve caused everyone  especially mrs redburn  i know she and mr redburn had divorced  but because of what happened he had no chance to change  people can change  suffering makes people change  there s no way to understand why you survive your child  grief makes you angry  there s nowhere to turn  no escape  nine years of working in the hospice could no way prepare me for that  i d stay on at work  or walk the streets  i couldn t go back home  knowing i would see something that belongs to her  something i couldn t bear to give away  when your mother died mona  social services said you were too little for me to cope on my own  they wanted to put you in a foster home  but i wouldn t let them  we were just fine  i ve asked myself over and over  why you had to do that paper round  i shouldn t have let you  i shouldn t have  you wanted to save up to go and see nana in jamaica  you saved every single penny  it s all in the post office   249  you just needed 60 more  i failed you  and now you re gone  gone forever  and nothing will ever bring you back  i even did your round  just to be on the streets where you d been  then one morning  i saw him  i heard a screech of tyres  he s innocent   and there he was driving that same lorry again  it was just four weeks after the courts let him off  there he was like nothing had ever happened  something inside me snapped  i just sat down on the kerb and cried  he s not guilty  i don t remember much after that  we made a mistake  i just wanted to stop him from killing mona  stop him from killing my little girl  i m sorry  i m sorry  thank you mr haart  perhaps someone has some tissues  is there  a possibility  that you may have made a mistake in the light of what you ve just heard  my lord you can t do this the verdict is final  it s perfectly in order to do so there is a precedent  the queen and ms casarotto is the authority  that was a totally different situation the foreman made a mistake  you re asking the jury to change their minds after what they ve heard   the queen and maloney  calm yourself mr stafford clark  i m just checking whether as you so helpfully put it the foreman made a mistake  my lord  my lord we did get it wrong  we want to change the verdict  this is completely irregular  no mistakes do happen i accept what the jury has said  take the verdict again mr clerk  the judge is behind you not in front take the verdict again  now  do you find the defendant maurice haart guilty or not guilty of murder  not guilty  do you find the defendant in the alternative  guilty or not guilty of manslaughter by reason of provocation  we find the defendant not guilty  you  find him not guilty of murder and not guilty of manslaughter  yes my lord not guilty  very well  i accept your changed verdict off you go mr haart  it s all over  all rise  do you think we ll get away with it  well it was a very popular decision judge  never second guess a jury i didn t mean them to let him off completely  that was brilliant john how did you know the jury would change  i m not convinced i ll get away with it  can t reverse it  well the permanent secretary could carpet me or the lord chancellor  then i am in trouble  there will be a letter of complaint from the lcd my lord  the jury made a genuine mistake  that was no mistake you made the jury change its mind  you shouldn t be a victim of your emotions my lord  oh shouldn t i  i await the letter of complaint with interest jo  better look up that case the prosecution yelled at me  a little bit of ducking and diving might be called for  i hope this means you re not resigning the law could do with more judges like you  this judge could do with a drink then lunch  then perhaps finally to make love to you  not necessarily in that order  i love you too much for that john   no  no leave me alone  come on woman  no  i ve seen him before  no  i ve seen him before  what oh gilly   how are you  we i wondered  you know you were going at it a bit  oh that s nice  not a lot bother nowadays   is natalie all right  she s fine  we re having a bit of a domestic  do you want to come in  no  no i won t interfere  you know what i m gonna do  no man s ever gonna look at you again  will the foreman please stand  have you reached a verdict upon which you are all agreed  we have  on this indictment that alec baylis did on various occasions  between the 13th of june and 19th of november last year rape emily bowen  a patient in his care at aldridge nursing home  do you find him guilty or not guilty  not guilty  you find the defendant not guilty is that the verdict of you all  yes  not guilty  i see  you re free to go  i can see why you might want to scurry away after your client mr machin  i don t identify with the client my lord  of course  our adversarial system doesn t always best serve the public you know  here it went seriously wrong  you are a clever and a skilful advocate no doubt you have a great future at the bar  i m sure you and i will cross swords again  i wouldn t lose sleep over that horrible man judge  the police have more charges of sexual abuse in the pipeline  good  is this so the lord chancellor can spy on us  mr justice nivan has a big terrorism case  right they come on when the building s empty my lord  and you can override the system yourself like this okay  deputy assistant commissioner colemore rang sir he said he might be a few minutes late  hello  yeah i m well thank you and you good  tonic water please  must be the malarial mosquitoes  the quinine  they no longer put quinine in it  we know each other don t we   john deed  i know who you are  we haven t met   you a lawyer  no  i sometimes work for the probation service but actually i m a publisher  ah  lucky readers  that s not the sort of publishing i m in   are you going to give me a clue  no  we have so much in common  a liking for straight tonic water is hardly the basis for a lasting friendship  well it s a start  that smile could change the world  i think you re making me blush  would it make you blush if i asked you to have dinner   i m waiting for someone  so am i we could leave them to have dinner  i don t think my husband would be amused  very well there you are  yes   what did he want  oh we have a mutual liking for tonic water  is that why you gave him your card  were you spying ian  i asked him if he d like to write a piece about the problems of interpreting the law  in the context of the human rights act  i ll have the department find you someone more reliable  i m not sure i want reliable  it can t be murder you want me to do row  it s a much smaller favour  there s a section 20 coming up for sentencing might you dig it out  are you asking me as a friend or as a deputy assistant commissioner  he pleaded to it presumably  it s domestic violence the police shouldn t involve themselves at all  wives are citizens too row  no the problem is they make lousy witnesses  as you know most won t give evidence against their husbands  why are you involved  he s a police informant  he must be a pretty important one for you to approach me   this one works for mi5  ah  do we know the details  i see  well it s usually a brown envelope job  the senior policeman slips the judge the details  which he reads but doesn t refer to it in sentencing  mi5 want him to walk john  well that would depend on the circumstances  well he put his hand up he pleaded guilty  that would help  he is very important john  okay  the main question would be  will he beat his wife again   you re missing the point  no  it s not my bag row purple judges deal with sentencing  chummy could expect two years for that kind of offence  how can i persuade you to get involved  you could try an exceptional dinner  mr children there s a section 20 in the list for sentencing  i could deal with it now  it s been assigned to judge home my lord  do we know why he s pleading guilty  the wife s the chief prosecution witness  the cps says she s not reliable they can t run her  all the more reason for him not to plead guilty  it was reduced from a section 18 my lord  oh was it   do you have a particular interest my lord  no  i m sure judge home will deal with it  i have a very sensitive date rape that needs looking at my lord  judge home i m john deed  oh yes i know who you are   where are you up to  seven down m something n  minaret  there s a section 20 in the list for sentencing  would you like me to hear it  red judges don t normally hear cases for sentencing  it would be very helpful to the state if this man walked   who ve we drawn  mr justice deed  lightning can t strike in the same place twice   he interferes a lot but we could do worse  not me we recently had a spat  if my client gets less than 15 years it ll be a result  that s what i expect  jo mills i m prosecuting  tim collier paul bailey and colin gee  you are jointly charged on count one of this indictment with rape  contrary to section i subsection i of the sexual offences act 1956  the particulars of the offence are that on february 14th  you had sexual intercourse with carol gainer without her consent  and knowing she did not consent  how do you plead guilty or not guilty   tim collier  not guilty it s outrageous   paul bailey  same as him absolutely  take your hands out of your pockets  just respond to the charge not guilty  absolutely sir  colin gee  not guilty  on the second count of this indictment  you are charged with administering a stupefying substance  namely rohypnol  contrary to section 22 of the offences against the person act  who is for the first defendant  oh mr machin we meet again  and so soon  with a clean slate i trust my lord  ready to open mrs mills  might i request reporting restrictions remain in place to protect the complainant s anonymity  my lord the defendants have no anonymity and as such are denied a fair trial  as set out in the european convention on human rights article 6  you re quite right mr machin but article 10 of the same convention  guarantees freedom of expression  this case is going to be troublesome  i can see how machin is going to run his defence i m not sure if i don t support him  especially since the home office has emasculated most of the defendants rights in rape cases  unless someone helps these women men will get away with murder  bad law don t make for good justice  that attitude doesn t help anyone  oh i m sorry my lord  no idea you felt so strongly coop  i shouldn t have spoken i m sorry  did something happen to you  a friend of mine we were in the army my lord  she was raped  she never got over it  was the perp caught  he was  maureen wasn t able to give evidence  oh i m sorry coop  it still doesn t do to distort the law  i ll get you a coffee and a sandwich my lord  coop  i do still prefer judge  dr spazmani  from your physical examination of the alleged rape victim  did you form an opinion as to how often she had had sex  on the night of the rape  the alleged rape doctor  no that might overburden the medical research in general   my lord  yes  mr machin under section 41 of the youth justice and criminal evidence act 1999  you can t run this defence without leave you know the provisions  you can only ask about the defendant s alleged sexual experience with the victim  my lord i would like to make a submission in the absence of the jury  thought you might  i suspect you ll be going out quite often if you wouldn t mind for now  well we do seek leave to introduce the sexual experiences of the complainant  by other than the defendants  our research shows that  to put not too fine a point on it the complainant was easy meat  you cannot give leave if the defence are now running as consent  we re arguing that as the complainant was offering herself to all and sundry  on the night in question as witnesses will show she did on numerous other occasions  the defendants would have no possible need to drug and rape her  i m going to allow your submission  i think not to do so would render any conviction unsafe  but stray over the margins and i ll hit you like a runaway train  let s have the jury back   is this a woman who had sex often  oh there s no way i could tell that sir   well she wasn t a virgin  no  you agree she enjoyed a healthy sex life  you ve had your answer mr machin now move on  doctor was there any sign of the alleged drug in the woman s body after the alleged rape  no that s not unusual with rohypnol  i don t want a commentary doctor there was none of this drug in the woman s body  no  remind the jury why this drug wasn t found  its distillution crystals help flush it through the kidneys  because you re not drowsy or groggy during the period of recovery  you have no conscious memory of it  so the drug takes you directly from unconscious to wide awake  exactly  we only remember when our deep subconscious  is brought through in the semiconscious or groggy states  so she might just as easily have not been given the drug  yes my lord there is no way of knowing  doctor the other conspicuously vague piece of evidence my learned colleague examined you on  was the contents of the vagina  you found the presence of blood type o semen  but as two of the accused rapists are blood type o  as were probably half the men in the club that night  in theory she could ve had sex with any one of them  is that a question mr machin  i m working up to it doctor is there any evidence to suggest  that it couldn t have been any one or more  of the majority of o blood types in the club that night that had sex with carol gainer  well that isn t my concern as the medical examiner  please answer the question doctor  no  i believe you made other tests  which the prosecution conspicuously failed to mention  yes we ran dna tests  well we all know how accurate dna tests are doctor so tell us  as mrs mills failed to do so what the results showed  there was no dna match with the defendants  why is that in your opinion doctor  did the robust dna give a false reading  i don t know perhaps they wore condoms  my lord i would like the jury instructed to disregard this facetious speculation  well you invited an opinion from an expert witness you got it  my lord we intend calling carol gainer next  she s having problems going into the witness box might we have a short adjournment  my lord the defendants have had this hanging over them for four months  now is the moment of truth for their accuser  it is something i have to consider mrs mills  she could give evidence over a video link if it helps  she would like to try to give evidence in person  how long might you need  well she s very nervous of the defendants  well i m reluctant to become a hostage to her nerves  the very principal of our judicial system is that the defendants have the opportunity  to face their accuser  i think in view of the hour mrs mills it might be a sensible time to adjourn till the morning  come in  my lord i m sorry to bother you  the section 20 the wife beater you were after has come free  i thought judge home was dealing with it  he s hearing a protracted legal argument  i don t think i really want it  they are awaiting a disposal today  we d be most grateful to your lordship  very well  having heard the mitigation for what it s worth  are there exceptional circumstances why mr abbott should not go to prison  beating his wife notwithstanding he can t be all bad  mr abbott what do you say  i m very very sorry for what i did  i had been drinking  but that s no excuse for it  it s a start  i would like to hear from somebody else  i m inspector troy martin my lord i was the charging officer  the defendant was helpful and cooperated fully he was clearly full of remorse  this was after he d sobered up  my lord  mr abbott said he d been drinking  i don t know he wasn t drunk when i saw him at the station  the police don t often respond to domestic violence do they inspector  we try to police all crime according to the priorities  as your lordship knows we re not bound to prosecute  a bit of domestic isn t high priority  most of it s husbands and wives fighting when they ve been drinking  when the wife gets a bashing and the police don t arrive in time to stop it  we do stop a lot of it my lord  hmm  what were the circumstances of your involvement with mr abbott  we were called to the hospital by the a e doctor who treated mrs abbott  and mr abbott was giving comfort now sober  it wasn t me who went to the hospital  then it might have been more sensible to have the person here who did  was mrs abbott hospitalised  doesn t anyone know i don t seem to have any medical notes for her  yes she was sir  to my unending shame  you re making the right noises for the court to deal with you in an appropriate way mr abbott  oh god  i d better see some reports i ll adjourn sentencing until i do  my lord if it could be disposed of now  no i m afraid it can t mr maudling  all rise  i m amazed you spend so much time here row  i was in the county liaising  john i thought he was walking i ve assured people he was  it s minor domestic it makes no difference to anyone  not even his wife  if i m to let him walk i need to find exceptional circumstances  i m sure you don t want it mentioned in court that he s an exceptionally important snitch  good afternoon  sir ian rochester please it s row colemore  i assume the day didn t go well  it s not working with john deed   i m surprised you thought it would row  he s a friend  i m afraid i can t influence him  look can we get the case in front of another judge  abbott s not effective with this over him  short of a major accident  not even the lord chancellor could take the case away from him  we need to find a way to outmanoeuvre deed  miss gainer if you feel you have to stop  or you need help with anything you please let me know  in your own time miss gainer  will you tell us what happened to you on the night of february the 14th  i was supposed to meet a friend outside the blue haze club at 10 00  but she didn t show up but i went in anyway  i knew rock who looked after the door so i knew i d see someone i know in there  and my friend s brother tim was there with the others  which others can you identify them  paul and colin   how well did you know these men  i only knew tim  he d asked me out a few times  fat chance  if you as much as utter another sound during this testimony  you ll be downstairs before you draw your second breath so button it  he thought he was it  you know but talking to someone is better than being on your own  the other two were okay colin was quiet and nice  when he said something sweet tim would make a crack  did you accept drinks off these men miss gainer  my lord  mrs mills you know better than to lead the witness  miss gainer did you have any drinks that evening  yes i had a few   did you buy them for yourself  no they wouldn t let me  that s  just because they bought me drinks doesn t mean they could do what they did  can you tell us how many drinks they bought you  um about three or four  were you at the bar all the while  no it s a dance club so we danced  i danced with all three of them   together or separately  well both  it was after the third drink that i started to feel a bit funny  i d been dancing with colin then we went back to the bar  and i finished my drink  and then i just needed some air  um  sorry so tim offered  to take me outside um  then i woke up in the back of colin s car  with hardly any clothes on  where were the three defendants  colin was trying to get  he was trying to get clothes on me but the other two were outside  kicking a lager can  um  colin kept saying that nothing happened that they didn t do anything  he volunteered that  yeah  but i knew that it had  what they d done  um  tim got angry and he was saying  that i got hot and threw my clothes off  then passed out   did he say for how long you were out  no they kept changing the time  and laughing at me and saying that nothing happened  but i know that it did  um  because i hurt down there  well i just felt really weird  like  i don t know i just felt weird  isn t the truth of this situation  that you asked them for sex and they turned you down  no  isn t that why you hang out with jenny collier to get to her brother  no  didn t jenny collier tell you repeatedly you wouldn t pull her brother  no that s not true  how many times did you have sex that night  i don t know ask them  didn t you in fact agree and overdo it  even for your own voracious appetite  didn t you in fact feel self loathing and disgust  and pick on these three chumps in order to assuage your own feeling  that is not true i didn t go with anyone else  can you even count the number of men you ve been with   my lord  it s enough mr machin  my lord my client is innocent as are his co defendants  this witness is a fantasist  okay would the jury go out please  i let that go on hoping you d show some regard for the witness s sensibilities  she s shown none for my clients  and how did you find those mr machin with a pickaxe  under the human rights act we must be allowed to represent our clients  in my court counsel does that with reasonable regard to a vulnerable witness  not by hectoring and badgering  if you can t constrain yourself let one of the others lead  now get out get yourself a cup of tea  i know i need one   look even for him he s getting quite tetchy  i m really getting to him  we ll have this on a retrial if he keeps interrupting  judge the section 20 is being hawked around the other judges  he can t do that  tell the list clerk i want to see him no i ll do it myself   where s the listing clerk  he s been taken ill my lord  he ll be a permanent invalid when i ve done with him   is he canvassing a case i ve started  i would hope not my lord  he just felt that domestic violence for sentencing wasn t worthy of your superior mind  well it s getting it this is a gross lapse in etiquette  i ll talk to the circuit president  aren t you making a fuss about nothing john  no there s a principle at stake that nobody can take a case once i ve started  i find it easier to let these people organise the work  well we did michael we let them organise the digs and the food s inedible  i m sure you re right   i m only going for a drink  is that wise my lord  come on stephen one s not gonna hurt me you can t you re on duty  give me the keys  that was quick  i hope it s my call you were waiting for it s john deed  yes i don t know anyone else as confident  is that good or bad  not necessarily bad  would you like to have dinner with me or a drink   i m not sure if i should  i m certain you should  my lord  the lord chancellor asked me to have a word  you must stop resisting your security personnel   why with all these cameras watching us  it s for your own safety sir john   is this an official warning sir ian  that would be for the lord chancellor  but i am at a loss to know why you re so keen on this section 20  you know as well as i do what s going on  i have to find just cause for a non custodial sentence  that would save a lot of red faces  my lord  i still don t have the papers i asked for  enough time has elapsed for them to have arrived  they seem to be lost my lord  then how will mr abbott get a fair hearing  the defendant has pleaded guilty  then how will i arrive at an appropriate sentence or will you tell me  no one thought we d need the papers  i said yesterday i wanted the papers  i have another case i want everyone to remain in the vicinity of the court  to be called back the moment they are found  then we will settle mr abbott s sentence  are you all right judge  have you read the papers in the abbott case  oh word is he did some awful things to his wife  you do wonder about people  i want counsel in here when we resume with the abbott trial coop  my lord the main witness for the prosecution is not yet fully recovered  might we extend the adjournment in the hope that she will recover  is there a reasonable chance of that  the doctor sedated her i m afraid it s causing as many problems as it s solving my lord  very well i ll adjourn until 10 tomorrow morning  then we will have to take a view about the witness and whether she can continue  till the morning  all rise   john are they here  double or quits the case collapses tomorrow  his lordship would like to see you in chambers  it would ve saved more time if i d had the papers from the start  i have to ask if this is an appropriate case for a guilty plea to be entered  the cps feels it s appropriate my lord  they seen the papers or were they told they were lost  they thought it would be a reasonable result in the circumstances   mrs abbott is not a reliable witness  you surprise me mr brett smith  how do you think you d fare if you d been held down beaten with an iron bar  and had boiling water poured on your crotch  or possibly the man is not guilty on the grounds of automatism  why don t we test him in court on the original section 18 charge in the indictment  my lord the cps must determine the charge   then go and do it  but my lord it s been done   the prosecution is content with the plea  i m not go look at it again  john  with such volume going through the courts  how do you suppose the system would cope without plea bargaining  hasn t the attorney general issued guidelines that plea bargaining shouldn t happen  it only happens in instances where justice isn t likely to be compromised  how and in what form cases reach the judge should not concern the judge  shame on you ian for taking such a narrow view it should be a matter of concern to all judges  if judges took a more rigorous approach there d be fewer miscarriages of justice  if you persist in this it could blight your career like no other  i ll take that chance  what is it that you want man   a display that says you re in charge  i am in charge  i will ensure justice is done  it s hoped you won t send this man to prison  there s something bigger at stake here  there is nothing bigger than a just outcome  aren t you being politically naive sir john  no i m resisting political interference from the executive  have you seen the injuries that woman sustained  of course not why would i  i cannot in all conscience allow the perpetrator to walk unquestioned  i don t believe you don t realise you can t change the charge at this late stage   i want to examine all of the evidence  you can t and there s an end to it  i didn t realise you were so dangerous  will that make you more likely or less likely to have dinner with me  i d best rescue ian  in case he hits someone  excuse me  ah john  i ve had an email the lord chancellor s office asking me to persuade you  to release the section 20 unless you proceed to sentence   did the lord chancellor sign it  i suspect it came from sir ian rochester  are you gonna persuade me  would you be persuaded  like you i take the view that the executive mustn t interfere  the department are afraid that you re going to be setting a precedent  as to what charge can or cannot be brought  they re trying to erode the right of a judge to examine those charges  so we can ensure a just outcome  they want the whole question in the hands of the cps  there are political reasons why this man should walk  the cps is politically compromised  you re an idealist john that terrifies them  miss gainer you stated you felt strange after your third drink at the club that night   how many had you had before that  two or three  so in fact you felt a little strange after your sixth bacardi breezer  and the next thing you knew you were in colin gee s car  scantily dressed with mr gee trying to get you back into your kit  yes that s what happened it did  with no single shred of evidence to support what you say  why should people believe your version  over three young men we presume are as truthful as you   they put a drug in my drink  but there s no evidence for that  just your word  by your own admission you re a very frequent flyer isn t that so  but i didn t do anything wrong  you approached tim in the club that night meeting his sister was just a ploy   no we were supposed to meet  she s not a prosecution witness why is that  i don t know she s tim s sister  does that mean she wouldn t tell the truth  we was going to meet  isn t it true miss gainer that you ve been after lassoing tim collier for a long while   no  you re a sexual predator who preys on men  and when you couldn t get this particular man you concocted this fantasy   no  you re prepared to ruin this young man s life  and two besides because you didn t get it on   no no  yes yes   yes  enough mr machin   you d do anything for sex  mr machin  will the jury go out please  my lord because this witness is vulnerable it doesn t make her right  you scarcely allow her to answer your questions if they are questions at all  the fact is she hasn t got answers  is it time to call it a day mrs mills  miss gainer wants to see it through  is she able to without greater damage  she realises she s not the best witness but she still has a right to be heard   my lord  it might take a long time  but then justice shouldn t have time constraints  i ll adjourn until after lunch to give her time to recover   are you directing me to go easy  don t push your luck mr machin  we re in and out like a fiddler s elbow  stand up please mr abbott  we re going to proceed with sentencing on the charge to which you ve pleaded guilty  in order to arrive at a fair way of disposing of you  i need to ask a few questions that weren t answered in the psychiatric or medical reports  with respect my lord i m defence counsel  yes mr maudling  you mind if i ask you a few questions i ll try not to burden your patience  was your guilty plea a true act of contrition on your part  or was it simply something that you were persuaded to do for convenience  yes it was true sir i m very sorry for what i did   you realise what you did to your wife  i don t know what came over me my lord  it was as if it wasn t me  it wasn t as a result of the damning evidence that you decided to make a clean breast of it  no sir as soon as i realised what i did i was so ashamed  i wanted to die  is this a recurring pattern in your relationship you beating your wife and then showing remorse  no my lord this is the very first time  there are a number of old injuries on her medical report  do you know how they were sustained  nat drinks a lot  she sometimes goes wild  oh i see  very wild  she certainly does my lord  i must be losing interest in the law jo  i don t wanna go back into court again this afternoon and listen to more lies  i want to take you off to a hotel  i thought your interest lay elsewhere francesca rochester  well i like sweet kentish cherries but when they re not available  word is you re in trouble with your sentencing   who said that  clerk at number 8   will you send him down  i ought to for talking about me  i m serious john  why look for trouble  abbott seems without any conscience  but he gets to walk  i m not sure that giving him the set tariff would help either him or his wife  it might stop him beating her up again  then he ll come out in two years and murder her  well if i m not taking you to a hotel  there is no case to answer  the prosecution has failed to establish a prima facie case  unless we are to believe the word of a serially sexually active woman over three men  simply because she s the accuser  oh i agree with you mr machin  can t simply take the word of one side we must hear from both sides  am i to hear any submissions from the other defendants  my lord in view of the hour might an adjournment until tomorrow be better  no we ve lost enough time as it is  mr westland  would you tell the court in what circumstances you had sex with miss gainer  it was last christmas  i was in the pub with my mate she was there i bought her a couple of drinks  we went back to my place afterwards  did you have consensual sex  what  oh did she agree  yeah yeah she did   did you have sex with her again after that  no sir  why is that mr westland didn t fancy her  she accused me of drugging and raping her  had you drugged and raped her  you re kidding  she practically begged me  mr westland i agreed an application earlier  to take you out of order because you were going on holiday  anywhere nice  yes my lord to ibiza  miss gainer alleges you drugged her did you in fact give her drugs  my lord i object to this unfair intervention  yes the stenographer has noted it mr machin i d like an answer mr westland  no  of course i didn t  i wouldn t know how  i m sorry about this would you mind going outside again  mrs mills would you care to make an application concerning this witness  i don t have one  mr westland is believed to be a man of good character as far as the prosecution knows  is that right mr westland remember you are still under oath  my lord this is an outrageous exercise of office  i must be a very bad judge mr machin  mr westland do you have any convictions for drug offences  two  for supplying  well i think the jury should come back and hear about them  how did you know he had drug convictions   was it a guess  no  one of the first rules of cross examination never ask a question unless you know the answer  he appeared before me a couple of years ago  when his mother named him  she obviously thought to give him something that stuck out  i m hardly likely to forget digby westland  lady rochester rang judge  she said dinner would be perfect  yes she s on the board of the probation service she asked me to talk to them  about sentencing  ian s furious at the way you re handling what he calls a simple sentencing  does he know we re having dinner  it s in the diary  this case is far from simple  he sees these things in black and white  it can be very frustrating  he always said he d make a lousy judge  too many of us see things in black and white  we don t ask half enough questions  ian thinks you should trust the prosecuting authorities  don t they have prejudices like everybody else  you re not going to tell me you re prejudiced  blimey not me guv  if i plied you with liberal amounts of wine and got you into bed  would that constitute a breach of ethics  is that what you intend  well i d best warn you  wine makes me sleepy  shit   deed  is my wife with you   would you like to speak to her  i d prefer if she switched on her own phone  your husband would like you to switch your phone on  i left it in the car  i m at a loss to know how to proceed  in the light of what i ve seen and heard i wonder if a newton hearing might not be best   my lord is that really necessary  yes  he was persuaded to plead on the expectation of a discount  i m not satisfied that the mitigation made logical sense against the evidence  i can order a newton notwithstanding the defence or prosecution  with respect my lord we have agreed the factual basis of the plea  and the problem is that your agreed factual basis makes no kind of sense  it isn t what happened on any view  my lord this does seem to be breaking the rules of pleading  it seems to me that this was a device to shorten court time and save money  not the best basis for justice  i will examine the principal witness here at 9 a m tomorrow   my lord might we continue this in chambers  yes   so you can stitch me up  no one s stitching you up  in my room  the serious problem we have is that mrs abbott is not a reliable witness   that s why the deal was entered into  it is a dilemma mr brett smith  the solution may not simply be to send this man to prison  i m now persuaded to that view my lord  well the prisoner s a victim of his own emotions  you could argue that before a jury  but i have compromised the prosecution now  then i will examine the witness under the newton revisions  and deal with this man as i feel is appropriate  who suggested taking carol out of the club  she was looking really done in   she had been drinking earlier  yeah she was having it large   how do you know were you with her  no she told me  you can tell she was relaxed behaving more like me  did you take her out for air on your own  no paul helped me she wasn t too steady on her feet by then   did anyone else notice her state  you re joking aren t you  the club was jammed loads of people outside were waiting to get in  someone did ask if she was on e  what happened outside  well she got totally silly  started throwing her clothes off we tried to stop her  but she just kept saying  don t you love me don t you love me tim  so we walked her to the car   with the intention of having sex  no it was a cold night she would have froze   how often do you have sex mr collier  what  your barrister subjected the principal prosecution witness to just such a line  i m sure mrs mills has an equally valid reason for asking  well as often as i can i suppose   how often is that  i don t know  is it once a night twice a night once a week ever  my lord she s not letting him answer  let him answer one of the questions mrs mills   this is exactly as he treated miss gainer  yes but you know better   was it once a week mr collier  i can t remember   you re a homosexual mr collier  my lord  well it might go towards his defence  no of course i m not a homo  so you re a red blooded heterosexual male  one who can t remember how often he has sex  but who expects the jury to believe  that when an attractive young woman bludgeons you with offers of sex  you turn her down  fat chance she had  isn t the truth of this that a chance fat or otherwise  is the one thing you never gave carol gainer  we didn t rape carol  we just walked her about in the fresh air to get her sober  thank you mr bailey   how s your love life mr bailey  i ve been married five years  i know lots of married couples who have abysmal sex lives  it s very good miss  did carol need fully supporting  when she was being walked around in the fresh air  yeah i d say so she was well gone   who actually supported her  tim colin and me  i mean we all had hold of her she was like a dead weight   and how long did you walk her around for  10 15 minutes i suppose  so just when was it that she started throwing off her clothes  it was when she came out the club   and you stopped her did you  mm hm yeah   it was you who stopped her undressing  yeah with the others  i see  then how was she undressed in the car  when colin gee was trying to put her clothes back on   or did colin take her clothes off in the car  no no she must have done that herself  but you said she was out of it like a dead weight well that implies that she was unconscious  yeah well not really  i mean she was waking up ripping at her clothes you know saying she was hot   so the drug must have acted quickly  no we didn t give her any drug   was it in the car that you all raped her  no of course not  look i m happily married  so you said but lots of married men like to take the opportunities elsewhere  well i didn t   did you help tim and colin rape her  no  all three of you were the whole time taking care of her welfare  yes   you re sure of that  we didn t touch her  at what point did colin join you outside  well he didn t he was there the whole time   are you sure of that  yeah of course  look we didn t touch her  tim collier said colin didn t come out of the club  you and he brought carol out  no colin was there all right  you certain   do you wish me to read back what was said  no colin was there the whole time  so tim collier is mistaken  well yeah he must be  i think  mr bailey would you mind telling the court what your interests are  football tv i can t afford much else since i lost my job   what was your last job  i was a messenger my lord   why did you leave  i was made redundant   what did you do before that  i worked at the hospital with colin   did you have access to drugs there  no sir i was a porter  and why did you leave that job  well we had a disagreement  what about  well they said i nicked some money from a patient  well i never  when did you last take drugs mr bailey  i don t have any convictions for drugs  that wasn t what i asked  my lord my client is not a drug user  let him answer miss yesayahoo  i never took drugs my lord  not even aspirin we all take those  oh you know i thought you meant  when did you last take a drug of any description  last night my lord some paracetamol   where d you get the tablets  i don t remember   but you do remember taking them  yeah they were only for a headache  then where did you get them  colin i think yeah he gave them to me  have you got any of these headache tablets left  usher   they re only paracetamol  but taken from the hospital   thank you  yeah well if you ve got a headache  then they give them to you  for a friend s headache too  my lord if i may there s a matter of law i d like to raise  oh really  would you mind going out yet again please  my lord i must protest the bias against the witness being shown from the bench  i m simply trying to get at the truth   hi  hi  thanks   mr radcliff do you know who i am  yes of course sir ian  i very much appreciated your application to join our research department  it was nicely drafted  well i m flattered you took the time to read it sir  well i make a point of vetting personally  everyone we re about to place in a position of great responsibility  simon dymock my former circuit administrator  tells me you re both discreet and reliable mr radcliff  well every job is what you make of it sir ian  with that approach i m sure you ll do exceeding well with us  how closely do you observe mr justice deed  i believe close observation of the manner in which he conducts himself  to be part of the job sir  we know his behaviour leaves a lot to be desired  i ve never been with a judge quite like him  there s a personal matter concerning deed which requires close attention  i believe my wife s having an affair with him  do you need evidence for the divorce sir  one feels totally violated  of course i can t ask you to act in an official capacity in any way  but if you were able to give me any information of any kind  i would be most grateful  i know someone in a better position to observe his lordship when he s off duty  ashurst  steve it s willy radcliff can you spare a moment  can i call you back in about 10 minutes  you re about early john  i ve got a lot to get through before my date rape case  are the sausages any more edible today  don t ask me  charlie s on my case about becoming a veggie  god knows what that ll do to your social life   how s she getting on with the law  settling into her new course quoting me  well what s the point in having an illustrious dad if she can t use you to win arguments  i m still hearing complaints about that guilty plea  i m still giving cause michael  sir ian rochester came to see me yesterday  he s still hoping that you might finally prove amenable  nobody s more amenable when i get my way  don t worry it ll all be sorted today  sit down if you want to  there should be water there  i have to ask you some questions mrs abbott   i m sorry for being so weak  don t worry  in your own time can you tell me about your relationship with your husband  well in the beginning we had a great time  he had a really wicked sense of humour he made me see the funny side of everything  but when i got pregnant he suddenly accused me of being unfaithful for no reason  were you unfaithful  i hadn t even looked at another man well not then  peter was all i wanted  his accusations came out of nowhere  in a garage one day we were getting petrol  the bloke behind us asked me to move forward while peter was paying  and he peter went berserk  i thought he was gonna kill him  i tried stopping him and he started hitting me and accusing me  i had a miscarriage  i couldn t have children after that and he seemed to blame me  he kept saying if i hadn t had the affair it wouldn t have happened  but he was being paranoid i hadn t had an affair then   did he hit you often  for no reason anything could set him off  he had big mood swings he even saw a psychiatrist as an outpatient  he stabilised for a while  a friend said i should leave him when i finally tried to he beat me up more  did you seek legal help  i tried but the police warned them off  he said they d always find me if i left  when i  when i met someone else peter found out and threatened to kill him  he beat me and beat me  i tried to run out of the house  but he dragged me back  he dragged me along to the kitchen that s where i belonged he said  he boiled the kettle and he poured boiling water on me   were you conscious mrs abbott  most of the time  i think  well i think peter took me to the hospital  um  i don t remember much more apart from what i learnt around the hospital  i was in a coma for a month  i had to have  12 different skin grafts  on my stomach and thighs   i think that s enough mrs abbott  no i might not be able to do this again   are you in physical pain  yeah i m always in pain  it s knowing he might do it to me again that s what i can t stand  what s taking so long   we were supposed to start at 10  they re still dealing with a case for sentencing  it s a guilty plea doesn t take five minutes  not with this judge he s very thorough and fair  word is he s trying to find a way of not sending him to prison  he s trying to do our minds  oi don t be a mug  i fail to understand  why the crown prosecution service consider you unreliable mrs abbott  i wish i could tell you that it s all over  but i might need to ask you some more questions after i ve questioned your husband  thank you  i thought we d reached an accommodation on this wretched sentencing  i don t think i agreed to anything  chaos will result sir  financial and judicial chaos   already this case has cost thousands  there is more at stake here  you can t play fast and loose with other people s wives  lives lives  barristers need to be elsewhere  you conduct this sentencing like a trial  i m attempting to deliver justice  we won t let you gum up the works judge   don t call me judge i have a title  i m sorry my lord  but without such arrangements the criminal justice system would grind to a halt  then where would the justice be you re so at pains to preserve  exactly where it s always been  in the hands of judges brave enough to resist the executive  the abstract principle of justice is something to which we all aspire  what a sad world it would be if we didn t have ideals  i didn t sign on for a 300 drop in my pay packet to become a legal lackey  we would all like the judicial system to be a rolls royce  all we can afford is an overheated vauxhall  the economics are no more my concern than jurisprudence is yours  this is the real world  no one denies you re making a valid point we ve taken note  that s exactly what you haven t done sir ian  it makes not a jot of difference  if this fellow goes to prison for two years or goes scot free   it does to someone  no  i m asking you sir john to accept the principle at stake here  to call it a principle is to honour it too highly it s a shabby arrangement  it s a collection of ad hoc and pragmatic decisions  but your conclusion unless appealed  will set precedent for any judge or magistrate to follow  good i hope so  i took an oath to serve justice and the sovereign not government hacks  one of the strongest principles of the british constitution  is that no sort of influence be brought to bear upon judges by the executive  i am a servant of the crown but it s not a master servant relationship  the crown hasn t had that sort of power over judges  since james i lost his battles with chief justice coke in 1607  it chiselled the independence of the judiciary into bedrock  it is not an instrument of the state no matter how much you d like it to be  as denning says i have a constitutional liberty to be free in thought  independent in judgement and free from fear  look to my authority go on queen and newton 1982 it s over there  the court of appeal says that in a case where a guilty plea has been entered  a judge can hear evidence on both sides with witnesses  and act as his own jury in both fact and law  you re not doing that  you re hearing evidence to charges not even on the indictment  the man pleaded guilty  the only submission should be from medics or the probation service  show me where it says i can t hear submissions or evidence on oath  from the witness box  your office as powerful as it is  does not give you the right to bring chaos to the lives of others   have you come to beat me up as well  is that what he did  put me under notice to give your informant the right result  not my informant john   what you don t want him out now  i wish  mi5 have wind of something big  abbott had infiltrated the real ira they need him over there  ah  well i still have to find the authority to get the lcd off my back  then i can deal with your man appropriately   i was gonna invite you out to dinner tonight  i already have a dinner engagement row   won t need you tonight stephen  but my lord it s what i m here for   you do make my love life rather difficult  i m sorry my lord  you know i ll only ditch you later on  i have to ask where you ll be  first of all the grange and after that well depends on how lucky i get  yes my lord  what the hell let s take the jag  willy radcliff  lady rochester just arrived to meet deed  oh yes makes you sleepy  it s nice to find a middle aged man who not only listens but remembers what you say   have you got a room here  that really would be pushing my luck  i m not very experienced at this  do you wanna come back to my place  your official residence that might cause a scandal  well i was thinking of my own apartment  i d have to call a cab to give my detective the slip  thank you   she takes the taxi to the good hotel  what s the cement that keeps you and ian together  money laziness bad habit  mostly money  money money  it s not that unusual  no no no it s the name of the authority i ve been looking for the queen and money  the judge resisted pressure from the home secretary and was upheld  do you mind if we go by the court and check it out  wasn t quite what i had in mind  i m sorry sir i don t know you  i don t know you either  i can t let you in i m not allowed to  oh this is ridiculous he s mr justice deed  it s all right i ll call coop and get her to bring her key  i didn t want to create a fuss it s the rules  yeah quite right ben  judges are the first to complain if we break them   i m sorry about the confusion my lord  no you were quite right to question who i am   do you want me to help judge  no it s all right thanks coop i can manage   isn t your detective with you  no i lost him doesn t matter  is this fun or what  ah   have you found it  well i found mr money  but it s not the authority   perhaps it s another money  perhaps it isn t money at all  yes it is  yes look the queen and money in the court of appeal  yes brilliant  sir ian rochester rang judge  he asked if you could delay the hearing he wants a meeting  my pleasure  warn both sets we might be delayed will you please   more delays why is he doing it  it s not a problem stay cool  well he must know something  i mean the way he looks right at you like he s reading your thoughts  yeah he knows all right   i mean how did he know about digby  colin shut it  the queen against cornwall is the authority that says you can t conduct a sentencing like a trial  mr justice goddard was stopped from so doing in 58  this is superseded by money in the court of appeal  in front of scarman in 1984  they ruled the judge s conduct of the newton hearing was correct  newton is a trial before the judge on the facts once guilt has been admitted  it s not supposed to be conducted by you playing all the parts prosecution defence judge  we re not that much at the heart of europe yet thank god  well i m not sure that the continentals don t get at the truth better than we do in our system  anyway i ve got no choice the prosecution and the defence are playing on the same side   you ll be overturned  i doubt it my authority is clear  was my wife here  these were my grandmother s earrings  it was lady rochester who found my authority  mrs abbott before you went to hospital  when your husband last beat you for how long had you been screaming  it s all right you can answer it from there remember you re still under oath  about an hour i think i m not sure my lord  and trying to get out of the house  well a lot of the time  did no one come to help you  someone came to the house peter spoke to them but they didn t come in  i see thank you  do we have the psychiatrist who saw mr abbott  there s two  dr oellink the psychiatrist who treated abbott she would like a word  dr malcolm was called by the police  dr malcolm first  dr malcolm you were called to see mr abbott  yes the police were concerned in case he hurt himself   was that your opinion doctor  no when i saw him he was calm  that s something he was quickly able to do get control  does mr abbott have any psychiatric condition that renders him likely to harm his wife  he has paranoid tendencies sometimes he doesn t know who he is  he can be charming and responsive one minute  and then quickly go beyond reason beyond control the next  there are schizophrenic tendencies present in his personality  is he likely to benefit from treatment  he has been receiving treatment with some success i believe  do you want to examine this witness mr maudling  no  dr oellink  i saw mr abbott for two years as a psychiatric outpatient  he is violent and manipulative especially with women  there is a real danger he might injure his wife again if he isn t treated   what is it that happened  the cctv camera showed them making love  is there a tape  anything that moves in the building after 6 p m gets onto tape sir ian   where is it  well the security office won t release it  they will if they know what s good for them  it s data protection law i can t release any tape without a court order  better do as he says ben he s sir ian rochester  i m sorry sir the tapes go to a security vault sir  not even the supervisor could release it without proper authority  i am that authority  make sure it stays secure till i get back here with authorisation  in the nine years since leaving school mr gee how many jobs have you had  two sir one in maintenance with glaxo for four years then my job at the hospital   and have you been out of work at all  no sir   what about the police any trouble there  no sir i ve always tried to obey the law  what nothing for dope we ve all tried that at some time  speak for yourself mr machin  i tried pot when i was 15 and i didn t like it  i tried it again at a party but still didn t get into it  at which point did you leave the club that night   i helped carry carol up the stairs and outside  you re sure of that  i think so  would you speak up please for the jury   i think so  you think so  we d all been drinking  tim collier said he and paul bailey helped her out that you stayed behind why is that   i don t know miss  is mr collier mistaken on this point  he must be i was there nothing happened   is he mistaken on other points  no we didn t touch her  she was drunk and you walked her around to get her sober   yes we did  you put her in the car where you had sex  no no we put her in the car to try and get some clothes on her   who took her clothes off her  she did  what even though she was drugged and had to be carried up the steps and supported outside   how did she manage that mr gee  i don t know i don t she just did  well she was being supported under her arms feet dragging  she had on a tight dress that had to come over her head  tights which must come over her feet pants a bra  she d have to be an octopus to get her clothes off  let s get real  there was no street detritus on her clothes they came off in the car  the other two held her and you undressed her isn t that so  no no it wasn t me   then which of your two friends was it  no one none of us touched her  mr gee carol gainer was under the influence of drink and the drug rohypnol  she couldn t have undressed herself  either you or your friends had to have undressed her  no i never touched her  on a point of clarification mr gee  what order did you come up the narrow stairs of the club  tim led with his arm under carol s shoulder paul was pushing her up i was behind them  momentarily forgotten are you an easily forgotten sort of person mr gee  i don t easily get noticed until something goes wrong  well you certainly got noticed this time mr gee  mr gee what do you do at the hospital   i m a porter  yes i know what does that entail exactly  i take dead patients to the mortuary live ones to theatre or for x rays  i deliver mail dinners   you have access to all parts of the hospital  yes i do   and access to drugs  i don t do drugs   you have access to hospital drugs  the drugs are under lock and key  have you delivered them to wards or theatres  yes i have  then you have access to hospital drugs  is that a yes  yes my lord  mr machin i interrupted your cross examination do you want to continue  thank you my lord  mr gee so the jury are absolutely clear on this  you ve never broken the trust you re held in at the hospital and taken or misused the drugs  no sir i ve only taken paracetamol for a headache   and usually the ward sister gives them to me  thank you mr gee   just what is this tape coop  it s from the security camera  it activates and records movements after 6 p m  well we probably see worse on channel five  sir ian has gone to get the lord chancellor to authorise seizure of the tape  to post it on the internet no doubt  get me a sandwich would you please coop  can you speak  do you mean have i lost my voice  we overlooked the cctv camera last night our every move was recorded  do you think it s a first  your husband knows about it and he s pretty steamed up  yes he would be  he stands to gain a lot of money his aunt left it to the two of us in trust  being a good christian her main stipulation was fidelity  if either is unfaithful his or her share is forfeited to the other  that s not enforceable in law did she use the word fidelity  the exact word she used  must be hard to maintain fidelity nowadays  generally or where money s involved  john i d prefer ian not to get the tape  so would i  i d like to see you again  not in chambers  well you ve got my number   mr radcliff  my lord  can i have the section 20 in after lunch please i want to question mrs abbott about her fidelity  i m sure you do my lord   what s he so happy about  word is he s getting promoted  never told me  coop  could one of your friends among the poles get hold of that tape  i ll ask judge  thank you  you had an affair during your marriage mrs abbott  was this a single lapse or was this a general lack of fidelity  not at first it wasn t i did have affairs  but none lasted long i didn t want pete to find the men and hurt them   but he did find out  right from the start he always found out  then would you say that your actions provoked the beatings that you subsequently got  i don t know i mean he s never been a very reasonable man  no matter what i did he got angry  how far into the relationship did you realise that he wasn t a reasonable man  i don t know after i lost the baby i suppose  prior to your last beating you knew he wasn t reasonable  you just couldn t get through to him  had you provoked him before the beating  i told him i couldn t take any more i was leaving i didn t want him to come after me   so in fact you provoked him beyond reason  i wanted a life i was entitled to that  the psychiatrist had said that he wasn t able to respond to reason   he s a madman out of control  you knew that yet you still provoked him  well what was i supposed to do what he ll come after me  his friends in the police will find me he ll find me if you let him go  mrs mills  is he gonna send him away or what   you haven t paid into the lottery pool  your numbers never win brian  all right then you pick them  what s the old cider lout been doing up there  finding a way to get me a result i made a clean breast of what i did  that s what impresses this judge telling the truth to him  mate is that right what he said  so it seems god help mrs abbott  tim i can t go through with it  course you can it s almost over you done lovely son   concludes the case for the defence unless his lordship has any further questions  as a matter of fact it does mr machin mr gee anything you d like to tell the court   no  i m sorry i thought you were mr collier  i want to go back in the witness box there s something else i want to say  would you like to consult with counsel first  my lord i must protest this is the worst case of bias i ve ever encountered   sit down mr machin  my lord the jury must go out  not until they ve heard what mr gee has to say  i got them from the hospital i didn t know tim would do that  i hope he sends them away for a long time  please stand up mr abbott  ordinarily a crime of this magnitude would warrant a prison sentence  a long sentence for the indescribable wickedness of what you did to your wife  however  however  i don t feel prison is the appropriate way to deal with you  it s clear that you were provoked beyond all reason  by your wife telling you that she was leaving you  because you were beyond reason you were therefore beyond control  i m also taking into account the fact that you have pleaded guilty to a charge before this court  even though the charge didn t reflect the crime  that charge was i have no doubt a matter of procedural convenience  on the part of the prosecuting authority  and one which you weighed to your advantage  clearly you are quite incapable of remorse  i m not going to shove you off to prison  instead under the mental health act  on evidence of the two psychiatrists that you have a mental condition that is treatable  i intend to send you to a secure unit where you will receive treatment  i m also adding a restriction order to this so that you will not be released  until you have satisfied a mental health tribunal that you are no longer a danger to the public  is he gonna send him away   no  what are you doing  no  get him  got him  that was a wonderful thing you did judge  not as wonderful as row colemore s alert response   he might have saved mrs abbott s life  only after you d given it back to her  deed  whose news desk  how d you get this number  yeah  yes when old hall at lincoln s inn was rebuilt in the 15th century  it was partly paid for by fining barristers six shillings and eightpence  for fornicating with women in chambers  i think they all went broke and gave up the practice  somebody s tipped off the newspapers about the security tape   i haven t had a call about it yet judge  well the express has  excuse me  can i help you  my authority for the seizure of the videotapes  from the camera covering mr justice deed s chambers  how do i know this is the lord chancellor s signature  are you being purposefully obstructive   where s mr goldin  he s off duty sir   it wouldn t do to give these tapes to anyone  i m not anyone  i ll need a signature   where s your video player  we don t have one available  this is ridiculous  find me a video player  sir  well where is it  where is it   the security man said they were at it  where  there  i d say it s been doctored sir  hello the phone is switched off at the moment leave a message and i ll call you back  john you know that fruit you thought was unavailable  i ll see you later  it was quite a punch   i ll have to find a new fencing partner  i ve got good healing bones   do you realise what you ve done john  probably saved natalie abbott s life  how many lives you put at risk as a result mi5 are furious  you can buy me dinner for my heroism in court   i have one to meet row  oh have you got a friend  are we still friends  he was only an informant john  friends aren t so easily found  judge  the tape from the security camera   it is the only copy  thanks coop  we ll have to send your friend some cigars  does he does he sleep outside your door  do you know i think he s genuinely fond of me  are women allowed back to your digs  well yes but the servants don t like it  see officially we d have to have separate rooms and everybody gets shuffled down one room  do you know what you d be risking half of ian s family money  ah but you said the fidelity clause wasn t enforceable  it s not  if you follow me stephen   but my lord if i don t follow you  stay  woof woof   all right barry still working on it mate  mum i got it  350 quid a week i start tomorrow  tony are you sure you shouldn t try to go to college  no it s a waste of time  i mean matt and luce need things for school we need a new washing machine  yeah i d sooner you d get a proper education love  yeah well i can apply next year  i haven t even got a flask for your break i ll have to try and borrow one from next door  i can buy one mum  well you d better get a week s work under your belt before you do all this spending  not that we don t appreciate it love  all i get from you people is excuses and more excuses  the weather holdups with the plant  can t get the materials can t get the labour  you make me die  i am not interested in your pathetic excuses sunshine  or yours either or the architect s or anyone else s  i do not pay you good money for delays  you want some i ll give you delays when it comes to your wages  you any idea how much they re costing me  while you re driving around in your fat mercedes sticking your fat kids through school  well what are you a statue   i was told to report for work  then get working

in love it s about your son tony  what what   what  i am so sorry  is he around mrs cooper i d like a word  he s very busy mrs mills i ll see   mrs mills would like a word judge  yeah sure   that looks excruciatingly uncomfortable  it is   drink  no thanks  i ve got a problem with a case i m prosecuting  oh don t tell me more innocent villains stitched up   where did you learn this bias jo  i wonder  we re running manslaughter against the foreman and manager of a building site  where a 19 year old was crushed to death   who are you in front of  a purple judge joan randall morgan  oh she s not pretty but she s pretty no nonsense   are they pleading guilty  i m not sure they should be there  in spite of the inquest verdict of unlawful killing  the cps came close to running corporate manslaughter with mike briggs in the frame  yeah  charges were laid and his lawyers prepared a defence and then days before committal  the charges were withdrawn and briggs squirms away  leaving the two employees in the frame  presumably with no corporate responsibility  what s the cps saying  well they re now saying there s no line of culpability to briggs  i think they were leaned on  hmm  i know he s well connected but even so  putting lowly hirelings in the dock is not gonna make companies  take their health and safety obligations seriously  the cbi would argue they already do  it s never the company directors that get hurt  what s your problem with joan randall morgan  i don t know  she s not likely to go to the wire on this her husband works for the institute of directors  then ask for another judge  we ve got very clear guidelines on what sort of connections require us to step down  oh no you re not thinking of asking me to take it  you might be concerned enough to see the right people in the dock  no not unless the cps is up for it  they d have to reinstate the corporate manslaughter charge  jo if the evidence isn t there  that wasn t my opinion  because of briggs s connections everybody s view was canvassed  the hse the home office the lcd the cabinet office oh yeah  when is it set down for  but the two defendants are employees  well the prosecutor thinks the wrong two are up  i d like to see if i can reinstate the corporate manslaughter charge  put the managing director in the frame  it s very tantalising john  but i don t see the government letting you get that sort of scalp on your belt  i thought we were supposed to be independent of the executive  so did i  i ll tell the resider  can i help my lord  i m looking for the queen and zajas and forsyth  the papers have gone to judge randall morgan my lord  there s been a change it seems i m hearing it  is there a copy of the papers  yes thank you  lcd laurence james  this is norman children the list manager at highfield  i was told to call this number about mr justice deed  is he misbehaving again mr children  might be something for sir ian  he s just snatched a case another judge was set to hear  do we know why  would you like to continue the opening mrs mills  my lord  according to the health and safety inspectors report marked 1 c in your bundle  everything that could possibly be wrong on this building site was wrong  an absence of adequate training  lack of safety overrides on machinery  some of the plant on site was found to have 17 potentially lethal defects  wrong equipment was used for lifting  inexperienced personnel were allowed to drive machinery  a lack of supervision  it was such a practice that led to the fatal injury to tony cootes  and the reason this was done was to cut costs  everything about the company that owns the site was geared to maximum profit  regardless of health and safety  we calculated that the owner of the site has saved a 6 000 in three months  by ignoring health and safety  some of you may have sons or grandsons of a similar age to tony cootes  and be shocked that so little value could be put on this young life  with your lordship s leave may i call my first witness  the health and safety inspector gwyn headley  before you do mrs mills can you tell us what the lines of responsibility are on this site  is it owned and run by briggs  it s owned by briggs my lord  but it s run by the contractor jack mcnaulty plc  do directors of either company oversee the running of this site  well it s mostly done by the site manager and the clerk of the works  however mr briggs is a hands on managing director  and frequently visits the site to hurry things up  are you calling him as a witness  we have served him with papers my lord he hasn t responded  well make sure that he does  i don t want mr briggs to shirk his responsibilities  it s plain what he s up to mr james  he s out to nail mike briggs  we re sure the department would like someone big brought to book for corporate manslaughter  speaking as a lawyer and a politician mr children  we see a discrepancy within the government  they want to be nice and cuddly to the plebs  but don t want to obstruct the wealth creators by pushing up industry s costs  and slowing growth  mr justice deed might come unstuck if he picks on briggs  keep me posted i ll have a word up the road about developments  inappropriate equipment was being used  the excavator on site should not have been used for demolition  had the company been warned about this  yeah we d written to them several times  we even threatened to close the site  if they had failed to rectify these wrong practices mr headley  why wasn t the site closed down  pressure of work my lord  we often can t follow up as we should  i see then perhaps there was fault on both sides yours the sin of omission  do you know why the contractors didn t respond  they were behind schedule and under a lot of pressure from mr briggs  once when i was on site he personally threatened to sack people  i believe he d been there the morning tony cootes died  thank you  this is everything i could find relating to hse s responsibilities  thanks coop  i m not gonna let the company escape its responsibility  because the hse is overstretched  there s a woman front right on the public benches  her face is haunting me  that s mrs cootes the dead boy s mother  she shouldn t be in before giving evidence  for compassionate reasons defence waived any objection to her being in  find out if there s anything she wants will you coop  some sort of justice would be a start  mrs cootes some of the events i m going to take you through might be painful  if you want me to stop please say  can you tell the court why your 19 year old son was going off to work on a building site  rather than say university  he couldn t afford to go to university  i d been made redundant  the building society that i worked for had been taken over  his father left us years ago and didn t pay any maintenance  tony wanted to be the man of the house  he was  cost him his life  he had no life  i m sorry did i answer the question  mrs cootes you ve nothing to be sorry for  emotions often overwhelm us in these circumstances  just take your time  how did tony get the job on the site  from the jobcentre  experience wasn t necessary as long as you were fit  tony was very fit he did lots of sport  had he done this kind of work before  he had worked on local farms and he wasn t scared of hard work  he d had no injuries on these farms  no he was good with machines  did he say whether he expected any onsite training  my lord might i examine the witness  yes of course  was tony getting any training  no i asked other employees there was no training at all  did you find out why that was  the company seemed to think it was a waste of time for casual labour  i must object to this line it really is hearsay  yes i tend to agree mr peters but i am going to allow it  other witnesses can speak to evidence of the system  i will remain alert to make sure it doesn t stray beyond what is permissible  you can go on mrs cootes  there have been 37 accidents on sites run by mcnaulty the contractor  three of them fatal  a man lost his fingers trapped under steel work on the same site  was this worker more experienced than your son  he was a general labourer who had been working for one week  he had no insurance card or p45  and did the health and safety executive make any response to that case  they claim there was no breach  do you know if there was   my lord  yes all right mr peters  i m letting my desire to get at the facts outrun the present law on hearsay  i never compiled chapter and verse on any other incidences but can i  what i did discover was a relationship of mutual dependence  between the inspector and those he inspects  the system doesn t work  and the courts do almost nothing  and the families of working people are left to cope alone  if we find that that is so mrs cootes  i will do my best to remedy that situation  mrs cootes is right about the health and safety judge  my husband s always going on about how the inspectors are in the employers pockets  human nature i m afraid  mr justice nivan asked if you could meet for lunch   did he say if it was social  i took it it wasn t judge  charlie phoned she wants to come for lunch  twice in one week she must be short of money  say yes to michael nivan   i m having the shepherd s pie  bad for your heart michael  it s not real mince sir john it s soya  in that case i ll have it as well  i ve had a call from sir ian rochester  i ll bet that did neither of us any good  he wants to know if you re going after mike briggs  what did you tell him  that i thought that you were trying two employees  is this personal between you and this ian  should it be  one can t help but hear the rumours about you and lady rochester  i think she s given me the elbow  francesca s phone  hello who is this  there is no case to answer here  the crown and specifically the hse has failed to make a case  failed in a lot of ways mr peters  they ve made a case here it s a matter for the jury  can we have them back   i take it you will be calling your client  yes my lord  it not my fault the boy die  i lose my job i don t get contract back on time  my wife and children in bosnia suffer  i tell the boy keep away from the building i tell  they tell me  misha hurry up hurry up all the time  thank you mr zajas  did someone tell you not to waste time on health and safety  i no remember  well as foreman of the site wasn t it your responsibility  no big man tell he tell quick hurry  you mean the site manager craig forsyth  not he he not tell  well is this big man in court  he not in court he own everybody  is this big man mr briggs  mr zajas  was mr briggs the employer of the main contractor on site giving orders  many time  did he tell you to ignore safety  yes he said don t waste time job behind   he your new boyfriend  it s a she  what s wrong with her is she ill   she s scared  yeah i can see that  where did you get her  i ll just get rid of this   she s scared out of her wits  she s been really badly treated  i m not surprised peeing on people s carpets  she needs to be in the country with people who treat her right  you didn t tell me where you got her  a friend i m trying to re home her  you know i can t keep her at college  no no i don t need a dog charlie especially one that s not housetrained  but your servants could look after her just until i find her a new home  no the way they treat us at the digs she d be better off at battersea   absolutely not charlie  you re scaring her  i don t care you re not putting her here find somebody else  fine i will fine  can i get you anything judge  yeah you can find a cleaner to clean this carpet the place smells like a urinal  she couldn t help it judge  don t give me an argument just do as i ask  you just get out  thanks a lot  you re not going to achieve what it is you re after jo  would the crown accept a guilty plea to something less with those two in the dock  what is it you re suggesting  got anybody sympathetic at the cps  perhaps someone who s sick of being told by their line manager to compromise on justice  just about everyone there  this person would need to do the paperwork  to reinstate the corporate manslaughter charge with the managing director attached  if the evidence is there persuade the cps  it s the only way you re going to get justice for mrs cootes  and if you just go for the company alone  the law as it stands makes it impossible to secure a conviction  the directors will just blame each other  if the site manager can show a direct line of culpability  straight back to briggs  then that might send a signal to companies to look after their employees  would you like to have dinner  you have one new message  charlie don t do this to me  i m sorry  i m sure we ll find some sucker to look after her  charlie where are you  just been put off the bus the dog was sick on the floor  will she vomit in the car if i come and get you  it wasn t her fault she s never been on a bus before  where are you  chas this doesn t mean i m having the dog  you still haven t told me where you got her  okay she was rescued from a research lab   we agreed you wouldn t do anything risky  i didn t do it  that s a start  it was probably part of some vital medical research  there s no such thing  there s perfectly viable alternatives  look all i m doing is re homing a dog  she s been living on concrete she doesn t even know what grass is  thank god for that  i wouldn t want to get mixed up with a dope smoking beagle  you do realise you re in receipt of stolen property  if i take her back they ll kill her that s what they do  maybe we can buy her  what are you gonna do announce that we ve got one of their dogs  forget it i ll try mum  oh charlie she ll shop you faster than a supergrass  she likes dogs  oh yeah great fine maybe she ll talk some sense into you  hello george channing  oh hello charlie how are you  keeping out of trouble i hope  yes it s dead boring mum  that s what it s mostly like being grown up  i m trying to avoid it  look i ve got a favour to ask  a what  thanks a lot  did you get a result  well  she would take her if it was the weekend  can t we just leave it here  why don t you  you d better pray nobody comes knocking on my door asking me where i got you  come here come on  don t even think about peeing this is carpet not concrete  why don t you help yourself   she s been quick to settle down judge  she s not staying  meanwhile  do you think you could perhaps find her some food  maybe a name tag  what s she called  i don t know never had a name she s got a number  well i don t know  call her rosie  fancy a sandwich  you re a right little eating machine  let s see if we can sneak you into the digs  the lodging s book of etiquette does refer to dogs my lord  i m afraid the senior high court judge s dog takes precedence  michael nivan doesn t even have a dog  my daughter dumped her on me she hasn t found a sitter yet  is she housetrained my lord  i hope so she s 21  see if you could find us some supper would you please come on  mr forsyth how often did mr briggs visit you on site to give you direct orders  not often but when he did he really did  you had overall charge of the site  yes  but he  he really let you know that he was the boss  on the morning tony cootes was killed what sort of a mood was mr briggs in  he was furious  ranting on at everyone for wasting time and costing him money  he said   i didn t get to be one of the richest men in england by being idle  is that why you neglected to train people coming onto the site  well we had a training programme  safety checks  it was mr briggs  said it wasted too much time  you were in charge of the site  you were responsible for such implementation  yes  why didn t you carry out checks and training after mr briggs had left  well i um  i didn t want the job to fall behind my lord  are you saying mr briggs ordered you to neglect safety  well  he said that you know if things didn t pick up  we d all be on the dole  why didn t you point out that such practices  were in contravention of health and safety  well  you didn t point that out to mr briggs  loss of job might have been preferable to a loss of life mr forsyth  thank you mr forsyth  i d like to see counsel in chambers  this is a procedural matter it should take a little time  so i suggest you slope off and get a cup of coffee  15 minutes mr harrison  all rise  coop see if you can organise some tea for us would you please  unless anybody prefers a coke or something yeah  ah no thanks  is she all right  oh do you want a dog  i m trying to re home her  i d love her wouldn t i precious  but unlike you i can t take her into court  it s clear that mike briggs played a significant part in this lad s death  i m going to suggest  changing the charges and the plea for those two in the dock  what was mike briggs charged with originally  he was charged in his own name with manslaughter  and his company mandle plc was charged with corporate manslaughter  yes if those charges were to be reinstated  i think it would more accurately reflect the injustice done to the boy and his family  would the cps reinstate those charges  well i have spoken to them at length they would be up for it  in that case  would your clients be prepared to plead to the lesser section 33 in the case  would there be an indication of sentence were they to do so  well if you were to take this dog off my hands mike i m sure i could prove very lenient  i thought this had all gone away george   so did i  have they got any idea of who i am  what i own  i give people work  i pay good wages  they re calling me a murderer  i understand your anger mike we ll argue it was an abuse of process  i have heard  that i m getting a knighthood this year  well this will put an end to that  did you get your letter from the palace  no  someone in government told me i m in the next wave  i can hardly see her majesty conferring a gong on me for services to industry  with this hanging over my head  it s outrageous  mike as i told you before when this came up  i m not your best choice of barrister for something like this   that s what i ve been telling him george  why don t you just shut it clive  i know what i want i pay for the best i get the best  these are common law criminal charges  that s not my speciality mike i could recommend someone  i am not a criminal george  i do not need a criminal lawyer  what i do need is someone who can put herself about a bit and make this go away  failing that i need someone in court i can trust  and that george is you  well i m flattered mike  if we can t make this go away  the worst case scenario is your company getting a fine   first we ll see about getting a delay  delay  i don t want it delayed  i want it out of the way  i m sure your gong is safe  my regional boss is not very happy about briggs being put back on the indictment   has he looked at the evidence  oh it doesn t make any difference jo  he s getting pressure from court services  cps isn t gonna back out is it helen  you persuaded me it was right  the judge thinks it s right  we cannot let mike briggs bully his way out of this just because he is rich and well connected  i m just warning it might mean trouble  people at the cps are giving me a hard time  you knew it wasn t gonna be easy  case is sound  this is politics  what is it you want me to do jo  look at my argument strengthen my hand with the cps  no it could put me out of the game completely  i shouldn t even be talking to you like this  oh oh i thought lunch was about getting me into bed  well it s about time  you ve been the romantic love of my life since you were my pupil  hasn t lady rochester taken that place  these things don t last jo  you think me foolish for pursuing her  she s an attractive woman she s also married  not happily  doesn t need you to decide things for them  get the boy s mother to leak something to the press about briggs s political connections  that ll persuade the cps to stay in  oh john  pop her round the green would you please stephen  you may have to run for cover on this corporate manslaughter  i ve had a call from the lcd they wanna know what s going on  what are they gonna do stop my expenses  they think briggs is not an appropriate target  fine michael i m all for abandoning principle for political favour  yes well it does sound pretty sordid when you strip out the niceties  ian rochester suggested a meeting to help clear things up  things are crystal clear michael  the government plans to bring forward new legislation in the area of corporate manslaughter  the legislative advantage of going for briggs isn t certain against what might be lost   any more  no thank you  mrs mills thought the case was sound  there is neither vicarious nor direct liability on the part of mr briggs  it s doubtful if the evidence would be sufficient to convict  have you examined the evidence  i ve examined all the cps has  are you an expert in the field  we try to keep abreast sir john  yes so do we mr james  what we don t want to do here as a result of failing  is make the cps more nervous about going after others  in your opinion  is there a direct line of responsibility between briggs  the ethos that he created within his company and the boy s death   absolutely  there  the cps sought my opinion on this and got it in writing  if you fail  or get overturned on appeal the damage will be immense  for whom political cronies  if the evidence is as strong as mrs mills says it is we might get the right person into jail  if we believed that were possible we d support you 200  don t patronise me your boss leaned on you to protect briggs s political donations  is there evidence of that sir john  if there was it would be the stuff of headlines  with the utmost respect sir john  this mustn t be seen to be in any way personal against briggs  i don t distinguish wrongdoing under the law  if a young striking miner can be held responsible for his lawless actions  why not a frustrated tycoon for his  the point is  how direct is that responsibility  isn t the place to test that in court sir ian  no  the dpp should decline to proceed  if he does  i will fight you in public  i can t let you do this john the fallout would be too great  how are you gonna stop me  it would be useful to know the dog is stolen stephen  what makes you think it might be  i m a policeman  her appearance coincided with the theft from the lab  no name  not housebroken  a scar on her ear where an identification tattoo was almost certainly removed  then i think we have to find some way to stop the judge being embarrassed by this  hm  judge oi you   please don t let him have died in vain  no no stephen stephen it s all right stephen relax   mrs cootes  yeah  my tony loved dogs  you feel that prosecuting the managing director will help  not if he gets a small fine  it s like a parking ticket to a rich motorist  there s never been any will on the part of government to punish them  i can t promise to get those responsible into jail  what i m up against is the inadequacy of the law  and the reluctance on the part of the government to make it more robust  well isn t that all the more reason for a judge to act  yes but there has to be strong evidence  otherwise they ll be stopped or overturned  the precedents that have stopped other judges in previous attempts  would also block me  what sort of evidence  smoking gun in the hands of mike briggs  is this the smoking gun   where did you get this  it was sent to me through the post  has the prosecution seen it  the case has been put back   briggs failed to surrender to custody  i heard a rumour  the cps will be relieved  they re desperate for you to finish your term here so they can put him in front of another judge  they ll be unlucky  i ve reserved the case to myself no matter how long i have to wait  briggs doesn t accept he can be prosecuted  well have i got news for him  possibly he forgot the memo he sent  ordering his staff to ignore health and safety directives   are you serious  mrs cootes doorstepped me  it is a smoking gun  if you can introduce it  if we can get him back into court  i believe he s gone abroad  fine i ll issue a bench warrant for his arrest the moment he returns  joe how are you  my god it s hotter here than it was in spain  michael briggs i have a warrant for your arrest  what is this a wind up   it s no joke sir you are under arrest  where s the hidden camera   if you d like to come with us sir  are you serious  very serious thank you sir  james get this sorted  did you hear me  my client was arrested as his plane landed   was he given bail  not without a great deal of fuss  he had to surrender his passport  the charge is a serious one  he has a habit of disappearing abroad   you can t do this john  i ve done it  you re defence council not my ex wife  you ve got a complaint raise it in court  you really do have a grudge against successful businessmen  i suspect it s to do with your own impoverished background  doubtless you can cite that in any appeal  you think my client s going to lose do you  i can cite that as judicial prejudice  george i have seen the evidence   i d get briggs under starter s orders if i were you  oh  the stop mr justice deed campaign is doomed before it begins  the fact is you cannot stop a high court judge when he s behaving perfectly correctly  not unless you wish to bring the law into disrepute   that s what he s doing daddy  oh no he s using the law  for the purpose it was constructed to bring justice to the common man  are you telling me my client has to suffer the indignity of this trial  i m afraid he does  and to add to his indignity it will be under deed s jurisdiction  unless you can show good cause  his blatant bias  deed is bound to overstep the mark  he ll almost certainly be overturned on appeal  but for now your client has to face trial  who s been instructed  he s foolishly insisting that i represent him  good  you re not a criminal qc george but you re an excellent advocate  you should get out there more often  see what you re missing  all rise  miss channing i realise one of the defendants  mr briggs s company mandle plc is a difficult abstraction to bring into a courtroom  but is the other defendant mr briggs not in court  yes he is he s here my lord  yes i see him there i don t see him in the dock  i m sure it seems unfair to you mr briggs  that we have to ask you to suffer the inevitable prejudice of being in the dock  but this is not a civil action  no doubt your legal team is unfamiliar with criminal procedure  you must surrender to the dock officer  do i have to do this  you d better do as you re told mike  some of them are such pedantic twits  would you speak up please miss channing  i said if you insist my lord  oh i do  i can be pedantic to the point of twittery  my lord before we move to empanel a jury  i d like to submit there is no case to answer on the manslaughter charge  the cps seems confused over the precise nature of the manslaughter test  they appear to have applied an objective test to his safety policies  whereas the proper test was subjective  a prima facie case exists at this stage on any test objective or subjective  as i understand it mr briggs had no safety policy  mr briggs wasn t responsible for safety policy  not at the site or anywhere else in his company  if my learned friend would let the prosecution open its case  before making her submission of no case to answer  she would hear evidence of mr briggs s culpability  yes i think that would be by far the most sensible thing miss channing  i look forward to your submission later let s have the jury panel  they re very young  come on rosie come on  the facts of this case are straightforward  on the 1 oth of march  tony cootes a 19 year old arrived to work at a building site controlled by the defendant  i object to the inaccuracy of the prosecution s opening remark  the site was not controlled by my client  well we ll hear that in evidence i m sure  the building site was owned and controlled by the defendant through his patronage  my lord i object to the constant use of defendant by prosecuting counsel  she is trying to impugn his reputation by association with the legion of criminals  who have stood there  you see this is a point which concerned me greatly when i was a barrister  when i started the defendant was called  prisoner at the bar  i m sure the prosecution will use the prisoner s name instead  mr briggs owned the site  mr briggs employed the main contractors  mr briggs through his company mandle plc has a controlling stake in mcnaulty s  the contractors  mr briggs was on site bellowing orders  the morning tony cootes arrived to start work without any prior training  the absence of training the same as the neglect of safety provisions  was as a direct result of mr briggs s orders  nice dog  who was he did he have any id  i didn t think to ask i m sure it was a policeman the way he asked questions  and he wanted to know how long i d had her  he was most particular about that  are you any nearer to finding her a home  the police have been asking questions about her  they wouldn t dare move against someone as powerful as you  i have to obey the law like everybody else   how is it the law doesn t protect rosie  it s meant to  just like it s meant to protect tony cootes  laws are in place to protect both of them it s just there s nobody to enforce them   what are you gonna do  arm myself with the law  make myself as powerful as you and mrs cootes think i am  you ll be told by defence counsel how many thousands of jobs are now at stake  but the question you ll be asked to decide is how many jobs are worth a human life  what the prosecution will clearly show you  is the direct line of responsibility mr briggs took for safety  when he instructed his contractors not to waste time  miss channing laurence james  yes i ve read some of your articles in the times legal section  its reach is wide  if i can be of any assistance i have people at the lcd working on this case  we re looking for a way to take it out of court   are you intending to share this  i think that would be highly improper   of course it would mr james  i m sure we ll run into each other again soon  was sir john always a dog lover   not in my time  george george  they ve taken mike down to the cells he hasn t had his bail renewed  you forgot to ask for it to be continued at the first adjournment  of course our dear judge didn t remind us how annoying  coop   why hasn t my client been released on bail  i received no application for bail to continue   are you trying to make a fool of me  i m simply obeying the rules  i want him out on bail  well i won t object george but application for bail has to be before me in court   court has adjourned  you can be so maddeningly small minded   do you want me to beg  let s hope they haven t carted him off to jail   would you like a glass laurence  i won t thank you sir we re in training  pity i hate drinking by myself it almost makes one look seedy  not even a dry sherry   well perhaps just a  perhaps not  what have you got  one of our researchers came up with something that might knock briggs out of court  is crediting a colleague generosity or a hedge bet in case it doesn t work out  it looks solid sir ian  in strictest confidence laurence i had a note from the cabinet office  it would be appreciated if briggs could be booted out of touch  show me  denning in bridge v neways mining  there were insufficient pit props and the shaft collapsed  the md had told the managers to put less in to save money  denning overturned the manslaughter conviction  on the ground that those responsible for doing a safe job  should have behaved responsibly and ignored the foolish employer  mike briggs could be regarded as such a foolish employer  he won t enjoy being called a fool but i m sure he ll live with it  john  oh hello you  now the housekeeper was complaining about you stealing a whole packet of sausages  she doesn t have very good taste michael  no nor your dog  um i m being lobbied on behalf of your ex to get you to dump briggs  i should be outraged i m not surprised  if it wasn t such an important case i d declare a retrial  and absent myself from it  she s done her homework john  denning in the neways mining accident  well i d best do my homework as well thank you michael  as managing director of a large corporation employing over 4 000 people  it wasn t and isn t my client s responsibility  to attend to the maintenance of safety throughout his business empire  indeed it would be an unreasonable burden upon him  therefore it is unfair to hold him responsible  may i point you to lord denning s judgement in the bridge and neways mining disaster appeal  the conviction against the managing director was set aside  because it was deemed unreasonable for him to concern himself  with the day to day running of health and safety  one man can t reasonably do this in a company employing beyond a certain number  where contact can t be made on an individual first name basis  therefore my client was wrongly indicted with this offence  yes thank you  yes the authority is good  it might have carried your argument miss channing  were it not for the fact of the directing mind  i think that lord justice brockway in the red burger chain electrocution  is a better authority here  let me see if i remember this correctly  when an employee was electrocuted  the owner of the burger chain was indicted for manslaughter having been the directing mind  he told the manager of the branch not to waste time and money checking all of the equipment  lord justice brockway spelt out the rule very clearly  when a company director is on site and becomes personally involved in health and safety matters  and especially when it also involves cost cutting measures  then he or she is bound to be held legally responsible  so i think your argument founded upon bridge and neways  falls when counterposed here with lord justice brockway  let s have the jury back  my lord i think lord denning is the higher authority on this  rank doesn t count in the court of appeal all their judgements are equal  i remind you that i have ruled on this  i would like an adjournment to refer this elsewhere  well i would ve thought that even you would know that in a criminal trial on indictment  the right to appeal any aspect only arises at the conclusion of the case  this is pure prejudice you re not being fair to my client  if you seek to disrupt these proceedings with spurious argument i will hold you in contempt  i hold you in contempt for what you re doing  miss channing if you continue i ll have you removed  you re being childish and contemptible  will the dock officer remove miss channing to the cells please  right let s have the jury back  i won t be kept here like a criminal  what what do i do  thank you hello  daddy it s george i m in a cell   what  deed put me here it s an outrage  you must have done something pretty serious george  for a judge to put a qc in a cell  well it s nothing to do with now daddy it s our past  you d have an awful job trying to prove that i expect he ll turn you loose   eventually  it s now i want out  he s making me look ridiculous in front of my client  well there s only one way you must purge your contempt  by apologising unreservedly  like hell i will can you do nothing  only the judge who put you there can release you   you must apologise  i ll die first   what  i have to take that madam   hello  oh  damn thing turn it off would you  hi  i might have known you would exact every kind of meanness  i came in the adjournment to get you out  not before time   well  first you have to purge your contempt  you must be joking not before hell freezes over  okay  isn t it true to say mr forsyth that the whole thrust of your evidence  is characterised by the fact that you were trying to wriggle free from all responsibility  no i m indicating where responsibility lay  well didn t you plead guilty in your own trial in return for a non custodial sentence  provided you gave evidence against mr briggs  no i pleaded guilty   to the extent of my responsibility  release her  do you seriously expect the jury to believe that an experienced site manager  doesn t have overall responsibility for safety  look mr briggs told us to ignore anything that delayed progress  now he would have fired me if i had ignored him  as the judge so eloquently put it your job was more important than a life  no of course not  then why heed an order that ignored health and safety  when in so doing you were breaking the law  be   i was told to do so  and doubtless told you could wriggle free  if you drew someone more senior in no further questions   do you want to come back mrs mills  my lord  was it normal practice for people in authority to make site visits and give you orders  yes the architect would tell you what to do the client would tell you what to do  you did what they told you to  well yes i mean that s how the relationship works with people above you  are you saying it wasn t unusual for the md of the company employing the contractor   to give you instructions  no it wasn t unusual  thank you mr forsyth does your lordship have any questions  no thank you   so you ve come back miss channing  yes my lord i  prosecution would like to call mrs cootes  mrs cootes can you tell the court tony s feelings on getting a job  my lord i must object his feelings can have no bearing on the material fact  my lord i m endeavouring to show the atmosphere in which he approached his job  don t see how this helps us mrs mills  mrs cootes since the tragic death of your son approximately 11 months ago  can you tell us how you ve been occupying your time  i must question the relevance of this  throughout my client has steadfastly maintained his innocence  his being subject to this trial is costing him a great deal  i hardly think it fair that the prosecution takes a charabanc  around what the deceased s mother has been doing  this is germane mrs cootes has made herself an expert on the ways the company worked  don t stray too far from the point  is she allowed to keep interrupting like this  do you mean defence counsel  yes if she feels she has a valid point  you are also at liberty to ask any questions you want at any time  mrs cootes  i ve been studying the enforcement  or the consequences of lack of enforcement  of health and safety regulations on the health and safety of   this is not relevant  i ll decide what s relevant  mrs mills   michael how nice  how are you  this is mike briggs i hope you don t mind we ve a con later  sir michael  you really ought to try to dodge john you know might avoid a total disaster  well isn t this cosy aren t you going to introduce me to your aunty john   you go too far george  oh i m so sorry it s jo  i didn t recognise you haven t got my contacts in  oh is that why your eyes are so red or have you been weeping with your client  i see you re still helping the third world poor buying your clothes from oxfam  i may wear dead people s clothes but i didn t actually kill them   what s that meant to mean  work it out your client will help you  excuse me what have i ever done to you  it doesn t take rocket science to work out why so many rulings are in your favour jo  your arguments were never sexy enough for him  that s enough come on let s go bitch  yeah you re right it s rubbish   oh how gallant you are  one of us has to leave mr briggs  i don t see why we re both grown up  i didn t kill that boy i don t know anything about him  look we really cannot have this conversation  your barrister made an error of judgement in bringing you here  i told her to i wanna talk to you  i don t think that s a good idea  let s leave mike before he bangs us both up  i deal with people directly call them up tell them what i want personally  possibly that s why you re in court  excuse me i have to walk my dog   what s wrong with him  i m sure george will explain  in words of one syllable   i daresay you know which are his rooms  oh yes  you lot always this charming to each other  i did warn you about instructing me for this mike  oh don t worry about it georgia i ve got no plans on going to jail  even if i have to go in the judge s chambers and straighten this  do we have anything further for mrs channing  a new submission of no case to answer  we ve dropped a few hints to ms channing off the record of course  whether his lordship will allow the submission  will it increase the chances of his being overturned  we re confident it won t get to appeal   then can you rid me of this accursed man  quite possibly  it seems he may knowingly have received stolen property  i find that hard to believe he s so sanctimonious  nothing of any worth sir a dog  it came out of a research laboratory that was broken into  yes yes  i can imagine sentimentality being one of deed s vices   how certain are we  there s a defaced identity tattoo in the dog s ear  we need to have it examined with an ultraviolet lamp  i m getting to like the sound of this  can i object to this jury   michael there s nothing i can do  look they re not even listening  and two of them keep staring at me  my lord in order to close the prosecution s case i have one more witness  he doesn t seem to have arrived  we re all intrigued by this witness mrs mills how do you propose to secure the evidence  if i might have a short adjournment  10 minutes i m obliged  10 minutes mr harrison  it is no good this man leaking mike briggs s memo  if he won t now come forward to give evidence   he s scared  well what if i were to summon him  well he d just deny it was ever sent to him  well he must want it out in the open mrs cootes  this is ridiculous why can t we just tell them anyway it s a fact it exists  if i could i would  the only other possible way of introducing it is to question mike briggs  as to its existence in the witness box  fine just as long as the jury knows about it  the only problem there is if the defence doesn t call him to give evidence  gotta go   that concludes the case for the prosecution  thank you mrs mills  are you ready to proceed with the defence miss channing  or do you have another submission for me  i do have another submission  then we d best have the jury out i m sure you re familiar with this routine by now  may i take you to the queen and marcus begley over malfunctioning farm equipment  reported in the second volume of the criminal appeal reports for 1967 at page 59  the case bears marked similarities to this one  in that through pressure of time the farm owner marcus begley  told his employee to forego safety checks  a loose flywheel guard on a combine shook free  and one of his labourers was pulled in and crushed  lord pendlebury held that not mr begley  but the employee who had been designated the task of health and safety regulations  was responsible  secondly why this case must fall is because even if mr briggs had given a direct order  i take you back to lord denning who states in his ruling that there is   no line of culpability to anyone higher where there is a designated health and safety officer  that was not my client  mr briggs wouldn t even be in court if the cps had been correctly advised  the prosecution has built a case out of spite and enmity on shifting sand  i submit there is no case to answer  thank you miss channing i admit to not being familiar with lord pendlebury s ruling  i m sure it s going to give me much pleasurable reading  i ll hear from the prosecution if necessary in the morning  until the morning all rise  i don t know where the defence is coming from but she s getting the goods  are you gonna have to let him off  you think he s culpable coop  if he was telling people to forget the rules he was the boss  it s hard to be brave when you re terrified of losing your job  yes i think that s what mrs mills is up against with her no show witness  if someone doesn t punish these companies how many more people will get killed or maimed  sir joseph channing telephoned he d like to see you in chambers this evening   what does he want  he didn t say judge  perhaps he wants to slap my wrist for putting his daughter in a cell  could you get me some coffee please coop maybe a sandwich  you ve reached francesca rochester please leave a message  but you don t respond  good move rosie   do you want me to take rosie for a walk judge  i hope my daughter appreciates this  oh it s all right sir i enjoy it  don t let her hear you say that or she ll dump her on you  thanks stephen   she s only just been out stephen  this sort of dog needs to be out a lot  well don t let her off the lead  stay there  let s have a look  you re a long way from home joe this must be important  i spent many a term as a high court judge here  well nothing much has changed even the decor s the same   yes but we had more servants in those days  i daresay they gave better service too   i have a difficult ruling to give first thing  yes i know that s why i came  ah do you want a coffee oh only one cup   how about a drink scotch isn t it  hm  you know i sometimes regret not specialising in company law  the city has such an influence on us  people who produce things are not sufficiently valued  people like mike briggs   i really can t discuss briggs joe  oh no no no of course you can t  we need more like him wealth creators  should do more to encourage them  he is held in some high regard in certain sections of whitehall  well he s very good at what he does  a lot of people of influence  think that he should be allowed to go on doing what he does so well   i have no problem with that  good  provided the jury find him not guilty  that is what we have to ensure  and how would you suggest that we go about that  a good many people of like minds  would count you a friend indeed if the new authority which has been presented to you  were to do the trick  you re not descended from thomas cromwell are you  no one s out to destroy you  on the contrary one day you ll want to sit in the appeal court become a law lord  be more specific how soon are we talking here  are you playing games with me these people would not be pleased if you are  the case may fall i don t think you can deliver joe  these are men who know that everything can be arranged  i would like to be able to tell them that the case is going to fail  i have a lot of work to get through  you re a foolish man john  these people can speed or impede your progress  oh tell me who they are i ll issue a warrant for their arrest  what would you use for evidence  smile for the camera on your way out joe  you must dislike deed even more than i  he took and cheapened something i cared about very much  yes i had heard rumours  there s a certain incontinence about him  whatever else he is ian he is not biddable  what a pity we ll have to fall back on plan b  i don t like your client s tactics george i m considering a formal complaint  this was none of my doing you know that that s why we are here and not in your chambers  you ll still find against my new authority  no you wouldn t do that  you ve far too much pride in your own ability ever to let this prejudice you  go on do you want her   as a token of my apology  charlie s already tried me  are you still sleeping with francesca rochester   did somebody put an ad in the times  it s a small world full of gossips  word is you re heading for a fall with her  just watch your back daddy wouldn t have acted alone   hey  helps keep the park attendant in work  miss channing  your arguments as to why the defendant should not be in the dock are persuasive  your authority is challenging  i can see why you think lord pendlebury gives clear guidance  but you re missing the point  lord pendlebury makes it abundantly clear that a health and safety officer  has to be trained and certified  not just a person who is nominated or assumes responsibility for expediency  part of the prosecution s case against mr briggs  is that he failed to take health and safety matters seriously  that he did not nominate staff to the purpose nor provide adequate training  in the case you cited there was no obvious single directing mind  you see the owner of the company had simply assumed responsibility  now this is a criminal case in which the prosecution says  your client s unlawful acts led to a death hence manslaughter  lord donaldson is the guiding authority  in the gaghan pleasure boat disaster where the master left safety checks uncompleted  in order to catch the tide  culpability there was driven by financial gain  now whether financial gain  drove briggs to have his operations run in a less safe but more economic manner  daresay that the jury will want to consider  let s have the jury back in  might we re examine lord pendlebury  no this is something you can do in the appeal court should the need arise  but not before  let s have the jury  mrs cooper could i have a word with the judge   he s sitting stephen  it s urgent  there may be a problem with rosie  laurence james at the lcd has guessed where she came from   where s that then stephen  i m not stupid  nor is he he could have the judge arrested  i don t think you can arrest a high court judge  he ll be embarrassed if the police show up  perhaps you d best take her to charlie  what s she doing here did dad send you  you ve got to find somewhere safe for her   oh yes why s that  the police are about to swoop on the judge  what  look ring your dad or mrs cooper if you don t believe me  hello dear is there a problem  there s absolutely nowhere else dad s about to be raided  well i m not sure you should ve brought her here  it s just a precaution alison i ll come back for her later   are you alf too dear  he s just a friend  miss channing is the defence ready  i have argued the defence s position already that position hasn t changed   are you calling your client  no  and have you explained to him the inference that the jury might arrive at  from his not giving evidence  he s fully aware of what this means   are you calling any witnesses  no  well if your client s happy with that strategy for his defence  mrs mills are you ready to address the jury  quite ready my lord  mike briggs who s standing before you charged with manslaughter  is a man of many parts  depending on which section of the media you read he s a working class hero  a product of thatcherism a bold free wheeling entrepreneur  names the media fight shy of calling him are asset stripper and pension robber  for obvious reasons mr briggs wields the power of the writ  and to be sued in the high court is a costly business  let s look at mr briggs the asset stripper  he takes an apparently ailing company puts it into receivership  and then despite promises to the contrary makes the workers redundant  a situation from which they have no legal redress  he then sells the separate parts for vast profits  mr briggs the pension robber  under past entrepreneurial legislation he finds ways quite legally  to whittle away the pension and redundancy payments  of those who have made the company rich  now you might ask yourselves why i m dwelling on these murky activities  after all mr briggs is not on trial for theft  however we would argue  that this lack of morality and responsibility that mr briggs has shown  informs the ethos of his company  profit at any cost  even the life of a young man who went off to work  with a borrowed vacuum flask and a pack of sandwiches  in the optimistic belief that he could contribute to maintaining his single mother  and younger siblings in their financial struggle  mike briggs was not born with a silver spoon in his mouth  but in abject poverty  he left school at 16 and went to work in an iron foundry  and within 20 years owned the firm  how odd that we identify someone this successful as the second victim in this case  but victim he is  he is a victim of the culture of envy and negativity that has pervaded our society  in fact what mike briggs really stands accused of is being successful  his hard work and initiative has provided over 4 000 people with full time employment  pensions and holiday entitlement  as common as it is to want to blame someone  in this case blame cannot legally be attributed  mike briggs didn t kill tony cootes  or cause him to be killed by callous disregard for safety  all he s guilty of  is supplying the lucrative contract to the company that employed tony  and for making sure they kept to the bargain   do we know where the dog is now  i ve not heard a word judge  charlie where are you   i ve only just got out of a tutorial  and where s rosie   the policeman friend said you had a problem  did he  well we don t is rosie all right   a friend s finding her another home  what friend is he reliable  she rosie will be fine dad look i ve got to go i ll speak to you later  fine  now if on considering the evidence you come to the conclusion  that mr briggs was just a cog in his vast group of companies  it is difficult to suggest that he can be responsible for all the workings of that company  or for the avoidance of health and safety regulations  then you must find him not guilty  if on the other hand you find mr briggs was a directing mind  that he did create an atmosphere within his companies and those contracted to mandle plc  it might be reasonable for you to conclude that you have identified a directing mind  in the death of tony cootes  and therefore a proper verdict would be guilty  deliberate carefully please put out of your minds any worries about wider safety concerns  you are to judge the case for and against this man  that is all  guilty definitely  shouldn t we have a discussion like he said  why he s just a slimy fat cat  my granddad had his pension ripped off by the likes of that  but i still don t think it s right not to discuss it  was it him who ripped off your granddad  i don t know well they re all the same employers   you make them rich they screw you  yeah  let s have a vote judge said he wanted an unanimous verdict   guilty right yes  can we recommend that he gets life  that s a bit strong he didn t mean to kill him  well he didn t care though did he  it s clear from this unanimous verdict  that yours was a mind that directed others on threat of sanctions  in the wilful and wanton disregard of health and safety regulations  and that it resulted in the death of tony cootes  you are hitherto of good character and have contributed a great deal to society  through the employment that you create  this i will take into account when i pass sentence i would like pre sentencing reports  what s a convenient date for sentencing   three weeks hence my lord the 29th  29th it is  george what s the fine why can t i pay it now   might i ask for the bail terms to be continued  i don t want bail  i don t think so miss channing  i ll be looking at a prison sentence and i will also bear in mind  that mr briggs has both the wherewithal and the inclination to go abroad   i ve got a lot of business abroad  yes i m sure you have   well i can t go to prison  you must consider what mr briggs is  your client was convicted by unanimous verdict  what by that lot good god look at them george you got to do something  i must insist  this is a get up  is it mr briggs  you re remanded in custody until the 29th  all rise   you can t get away with this  gonna try  it s spite envy  the working class mentality   trying to pay back the haves  oh change the record  you re stupid for going along with it   they the great and the good  the great and the good   in their smart houses and their close knit community would have welcomed you  you could have had so much john  george i d sooner go back to my dad s council house in coventry  than give up one principle  incidentally my sister now owns that house she and dad are very happy there  the poor are never happy that s a myth fostered by the rich   i don t believe this  to make the poor less troublesome  what you ve done is meaningless mike will be out of custody within 24 hours  yeah you re probably right  but even 24 hours in jail with no friends and no phone and no freedom  might just have him see the consequences of his actions  how novel rats usually leave a sinking ship  oh i think it might float a while longer   they ll come after you you know  for briggs i doubt it   for saying no to them once too often  well i ll go back to being a barrister then  are you ever going to have dinner with me  how about tonight  sir ian rochester would like a word judge  it s getting like oxford circus in here you know my number  you can t seriously be thinking of giving this man a custodial sentence  under the offences against the person act 1861 section 5 the maximum sentence is life  this is not the director of a tinpot company sir john  sentences for manslaughter cover the widest band of sentence for any offence  i will consider all circumstances before i pass sentence  under the human rights act  the infliction of punishment without sentence is i m sure you ll agree sir john an outrage  we inflict such outrages on the poor and inarticulate all the time  people at the very top want you to free this man sir john  oh really  then tell them i m not one of your under secretaries  i take no instruction either from you or from anyone in political office  i appealed to your decency you rejected that appeal  you might wish to reconsider this friendly request sir john before you re utterly discredited  and who s gonna do that you  you had in your possession until recently a dog that was stolen from a laboratory  it was removed from here by your policeman with the help of your daughter  and taken to one alison knight a member of the animal liberation front  you might not be subject to arrest sir john  but your daughter and mrs knight certainly are  excuse me judge your daughter s on line one and needs to speak to you urgently  doubtless you have a lot to say to her  chas  they have rosie they raided my friend alison s house and they just took her  how did they know where to look  oh i don t know your policeman must have told them you ve got to do something  i can t right now chas i m a bit boxed in   go to the police get her back  i can t  charlie i m sorry   then i will i have to  no charlie  they ll send her back to be killed i ll tell them she s mine  charlie you mustn t they ll arrest  judge  if you did what i think you did  will deed go after the dog  he ll try to help his daughter when he does the trap will close  provided the police keep their nerve  i m mr justice deed i believe you have my dog  your daughter said it s her dog sir  where is she  dad they seem to think i stole rosie from a laboratory   is that what you told them  no of course not of course i didn t steal her  well i always taught you to tell the truth darling i like to think that the truth always prevails   do you have my dog  we do have a dog sir  one we believe was taken from a laboratory  where is this dog  this way sir  rosie  how are you girl  she was with a suspected animal rights activist sir john  is that your only evidence sergeant  you d hardly expect me to ask a vivisectionist to be my dog sitter  well   i hope this is social  if you think you ve won well you haven t  it s just like old times   always have to have the last word  you always insisted on the last word   now you can insist by virtue of your position  i never took advantage of my position   you jailed me for contempt  you showed the court disrespect   you were being bone headed  i was being fair  god i hate you  you re looking very attractive  i don t think so john  you re still insufferable  it wouldn t work john  i m not one of your empty vessels  now we ve both been put out to grass rosie   bye bye sweetheart  oops sorry  could you tell me where i ll find thomasin wolff  26 one floor down  thanks  i m bringing his lordship in now  all rise  has the prosecution found its missing witness yet mr mcmillan  i m afraid it doesn t seem so my lord  the cps is still trying to contact him  well there will be some difficulty in proceeding without this witness  and if he does reappear is he likely to prove any more reliable than he did yesterday  when he refused to give evidence on the previous indictment  you see at this point i have to question whether  mr atkins isn t simply about wasting the court s time  or trying to damage the reputation of these two policemen  my lord with respect my lord  i wonder if the jury should hear such speculation  i think the jury is sufficiently mature mr mcmillan  such thoughts can t be novel to them  we d do well to trust in the good sense of juries  i would at this point like to make a submission without the jury  sure why not we re not going anywhere  would you mind grab a cup of coffee or something  i would like to submit that there is no case to answer against my clients my lord  there is an authority the crown against martello  though i am familiar with the authority mr stafford clark  i m not sure how it applies here  well we might need to chip away at the edges but in all other respects it applies precisely  well then we d need to have a debate as to your precise definition of precisely  martello fell because the victim refused to give evidence  mr alchorn the victim of the alleged assault in this case  is unable to give evidence because he s in a coma  he is still in a coma i assume mr mcmillan  he was up until the adjournment my lord i haven t heard to the contrary  there ll be no difficulty in continuing with a section 20  if the prosecution applies to amend the indictment  to reckless infliction of grievous bodily harm  are you suggesting that i change the indictment my lord  it s not for me to suggest any such thing mr mcmillan  well in the absence of your witness i suggest we might usefully adjourn  give you some more time to try and locate him yeah  all rise  i d be surprised if those two policemen in the dock don t know what happened to that witness  what are you saying coop have you heard a rumour  this place is full of them  there s no way those two are going to be convicted  so rumour has it  well i d like to know why people believe that  well they re certainly cocky judge the way they behave in court  are you going back to the lodgings for lunch  don t think i could face school dinners again  do you know what i really fancy  going down to the chinese like normal people  oh i m sure stephen would like that judge  i think maybe i ll give him the slip and go on my own  yes can i help you  is this mr justice deed s court  it s where he sits  court s adjourned for lunch i m just locking up  we re back again at 2 00  excuse me sir john i m robert home  yes i know  your clerk tells me you have a fraud case on your list  it s scheduled for next week  the crown versus jamison  i was wondering if you might like to hand it over to me  haven t you got enough work in your court  oh there s plenty of that  now you want some more  as a silk i specialised in fraud  well i ll have my clerk pull the papers for you  thank you i d be most grateful  is there something you need to tell me mr mcmillan  it might be best if the jury wasn t in my lord  we ll leave the jury in as they ve only just settled  you might prefer to hear what i have to say in chambers  the reason donald atkins our main witness hasn t appeared  is because he s in police custody  did you know about this  i did not  why would i  your retainer from the police federation tends to give you certain privileges  how long has he been in custody  since yesterday he was arrested directly after his court appearance  the police didn t tell the court  i heard nothing my lord  they must have known that he was the witness in the trial of two police officers  what station s he at  the high street my lord  coop call the station  tell the officer in charge there i want that witness here asap  i also want to see the arresting officers and their supervisor  brought here by the fastest means possible  the court will remain sitting until they arrive  make it crystal clear to them  that failure to attend will result in their being committed for criminal contempt  gentlemen  get your hands out of your pockets  i d lay odds that you ve never responded as fast to an emergency call  as you responded to this one  i m sorry but you have to go out for this  i know it must seem like you always miss the best bits  but if we don t remove you  we could be accused of denying the defendants a fair trial  you are  sergeant bridges my lord  why was the prosecution s witness donald atkins kept from court today  he was arrested on a serious charge my lord  out of what offence does this arise  out of the hunt meeting the defendants were at  i see  so the police have known about the possibility of this arrest for months  but make it the day when the man who is a pivotal witness  in a case against two colleagues is due to give evidence  is this some coincidence  you seem to have a lot to say for yourself let s hear from you  you can step down  name and rank  ross nye sir detective constable  given evidence before  yes sir many times  then keep in mind the meaning of the oath  what is your relationship to the defendants  i don t have one sir  you don t  so you re not a policeman  in the same division  at the same station  yes sir  then undeniably you have a relationship  why did you need to arrest the witness now  new evidence came to light sir  what new evidence  well i d rather not say in an open court sir  it might prejudice the other case  well either there is something wrong here  or you think that i m a fool  but i will penetrate this matter to its heart  in order to do so i m going to refer it to the police complaints authority  for urgent investigation  you can step down but stay within the precincts of the court building  mr harrison i want to examine the witness in camera  the witness is waiting my lord  this court will now be held in camera  everyone without direct business in this case should leave now  mr harrison get that lot out  i m sorry this has taken so long mr atkins i want to ask you some direct questions  remember you re still under oath  do you have any idea why the police chose to charge you at this point  rather than two months ago  have the police made any sort of threat to you regarding your giving evidence in this case  have you been threatened mr atkins  no i haven t  i see  are you ready to be examined by the prosecution  well that s what has to happen now we ve located you  let s have the jury and the public back  mr atkins  i believe you saw brian alchorn start across the ploughed field  with something you thought was alive under his coat  can you tell us what that was  it was a fox cub  about 10 weeks old  and mr alchorn was running away from the general scene of the hunt  yes  how far away were you when you witnessed this  about 100 yards maybe a little more  i believe you saw two men  who you thought were hunt stewards and you later identified them as off duty policemen  rush into the field after mr alchorn and lash out at him with pickaxe handles  are those two men in court today  no  let us be clear about this mr atkins  can you see the two men in court today  no  mr atkins  did you make a statement to the police on the 9th of march this year  claiming that you saw two men  who you later identified as pc baz fatts and pc grey palfrey  chase brian alchorn across a field where they beat him into a coma  yes  i was mistaken  when did you last have your eyes tested  uh about a month ago for a job application  do you have defective eyesight  no it was good  yet you can t now identify the two men you clearly identified and named back in march  why is that  i don t know  mr atkins are either you or any of your family being threatened  in any way by these two men in the dock  no my lord  i must protest this prejudicial line in front of the jury  my clients have no opportunity to defend themselves  well they have a more than adequate defence in you mr stafford clark  if that doesn t prove sufficient i m more than happy  to afford them every opportunity to defend themselves  they can make a statement from there  or they can go into the witness box and give evidence  that s hardly fair to them my lord  mr stafford clark  there is no stronger statement than one made under oath  perhaps i could have a short adjournment to consult with my clients  feel free  maybe we should go in and set the record straight  where s the harm   don t talk like a wally baz  it wouldn t be my advice baz  the witness made a mistake the case will collapse  and what about the complaint  first things first  my clients decline your kind invitation to go into the witness box my lord  they see no advantage in submitting themselves to cross examination at this point  i assume you ve warned them as to the inferences that the jury might draw  oh yes i have  the first casualty of such missed opportunity is inevitably truth  it s clear that the prosecution s witness was pressurised  and it doesn t take rocket science to work out where it might have come from  in the absence of his evidence mr mcmillan i m afraid i see no way to proceed  so in the circumstances  i would like to make a submission of no case to answer  no i don t agree  the evidence suggests that the prosecution s main witness was got at  we will get at the truth i suggest the best way to do that is a retrial  i m going to discharge the jury  meanwhile i will urge the police complaints authority  to conduct their investigation as fast as possible  with respect my lord this is wholly unfair to my clients  and just how fair do you feel that this whole sorry episode has been to the young man in a coma  my clients were wrongly identified  next you ll be telling me they weren t even present at the hunt meeting  so is their bail to continue my lord  no  i think there is a risk that witnesses might be interfered with  i ll hear a new bail application on thursday  my lord that s two days away  i m aware of just where thursday is in relation to tuesday mr stafford clark  till thursday  all rise  this is outrageous  can t you do something  hey hey grey we ll do something just a minute please  i ll talk to the president of the circuit perhaps he can persuade him to see some sense  judge home sent you this as a substitute for the fraud case you let him have  is it interesting  not particularly my lord causing grievous bodily harm with intent  could get it on tomorrow  well what about the mason brothers you did suggest you d take them next  oh i ll take them first if they re standing by i want them out by lunchtime  their dispute s been running for six years  and it s time it ended they re both the poorer for it  the section 18 in straight afterwards my lord  yeah after lunch   what weapon was used  uh fists   the defendant was a professional boxer  oh   would i have heard of him  i doubt it my lord some no hoper  johnny latymer  not only have i heard of him i saw him fight once in coventry about 10 years ago  i took my dad to see him johnny the animal latymer  the night we were there he chased his opponent out of the ring still hitting him  who s his current victim  his wife s lover fractured his skull causing him brain damage  sounds like a fair swap for the fraud case   are these the papers  yup  deputy assistant commissioner colemore  line one  row you still on for today   well i ve cracked my ankle  ooh badly  well fencing might be a problem i m in a cast  i had a call from david stafford clark the police federation barrister  and what was he doing collecting for the widows and orphans fund  well he knows as well as i do that i can t influence your bail decision  perhaps he assumed that as a fellow mason you might try  is he a mason  look i can t see any reason for not giving bail they re of good character  well we must assume that after all they ve had bail before without problems  i m convinced they interfered with a witness  well if there s evidence of misconduct  a hitherto sound witness suddenly heard nothing  saw nothing and now is saying nothing  these were off duty policemen john  they were stopping a bunch of thugs from spoiling a good morning sport  according to the witness statement those two put a young man into a coma  now he may or may not have been breaking the law  but that is not a proper response for a policeman on or off duty  if they re remanded to jail john their lives could be in danger  we might get the witness back  i really don t know why you concern yourself with such things john  i m convinced those two are trying to pervert the course of justice  referring them to the police complaints authority  is not a move that s going to make you popular with their colleagues  do i need to be popular with them  the police like to think that judges are on their side  this judge is on nobody s side  whatever happened to the wonderful impartiality of the british policeman  well much like the wonderful impartiality of the judiciary  i suspect it never existed  it won t do to upset them john  after all you rely on these people for your personal security  what are you saying row they might put me in danger  of course not but they are only human  no one gives of their best to someone he rightly or wrongly perceives  to be threatening his existence  hi  en garde  are either of you represented here today  i was to be represented but he hasn t paid my legal bills  he reneged over every agreement we had over solicitor s fees  neither one of you has any money left to pay his own legal fees  now doesn t that say something to you  about the rather foolish action each of you has embarked upon   he started it my lord  i was willing to settle   i wanted to settle  every settlement was disagreeable to him  and now you ve got nothing left  all the money from your father s not inconsiderable estate  money which presumably he worked hard to accumulate is gone  the only people to have benefited are the lawyers  if he d settled what we first agreed we wouldn t be here  he wouldn t agree to splitting the estate on the isle of wight  i did you wouldn t accept my terms  no you wanted to divide a perfectly good house  okay stop this right now  you have until the lunch adjournment to resolve this  and if you haven t by then then you re going to have to live with never settling this legally  for i will injunct you both as vexatious litigants  this means that you will never be allowed back in court on a civil action   but my lord can you do that  you can t  i can and i will  if he agrees to my terms it s settled   do you agree to your brother s terms  no my lord  he changed the original terms that were agreed before mr justice melchard   i never did  you did  enough  now i m going to allow each of you to make a statement  and then i will endeavour to make a ruling  to bring this protracted case to an end  now which of you wants to speak first  one of you has to speak first  alan mason  that s not fair  he ll use my arguments to further his i don t see why it has to be me my lord  has to be someone  well why can t it be him my lord  why not charles mason would you like to make your statement to the court  i ll be equally disadvantaged my lord  all right  slide along to the centre of the bench both of you  come on into the middle  closer  move in  closer still come on  good  now you have 15 seconds to sort this out before i throw out the whole claim   but my lord  you can t  no buts  clock s running  we can t possibly agree to this  then work it out and quickly   no you go first  no you go first   no i m not having it  it s you who should go first   you started this it s you  you always try to make the decision   you ve always been stubborn  you never do anything on your own   daddy was absolutely right  daddy was right   don t give me this don t give me that  daddy was right about you  time s up  speak  speak to me  i m going to count to three  then one of you has to give me a statement or this is finished  one  two   three  if we agree  will we still be accused of being vexatious litigants my lord  you re not accused of this you are vexatious litigants mr mason  i find no merit in either case  i m absolutely appalled that other judges have allowed this to get this far  it ends here and it ends now  now having considered carefully all the relevant documents  i find in favour of alan mason   oh that s wonderful  that s complete lunacy  you speak that way to me again you ll go to prison for contempt  yes you old fool just sit down and listen  and one more word out of you and you ll go with him  i find in favour of one brother over the other simply to put an end to this  i order charles mason to pay costs to his brother alan  in the sum of one penny  who s an old fool now  this is utterly preposterous  right that does it i hold you both in contempt  will the dock officers remove both of them to the cells please   both of us but  yeah both of you  see where you ve landed us you ve done it again   you did it it s not my fault  it was all settled  you are the stubbornest man  tell the dock officer to release them when they get there will you  he certainly didn t waste much time dealing with those brothers  this one can be very blunt at times  look at the way he dealt with those two policemen  they re not going to take that lying down  you sure you re not a journalist  me nah cross my heart  maybe she should come with me  my room was broken into  anything taken  no i don t think so  my laptop wasn t taken nor my phone  well those are the first things burglars take  one of those little dolls of grandma s you gave me was broken  perhaps it was one of the scouts broke it when she was cleaning  we don t have scouts dad that s oxford  i keep them in a drawer anyway  did you call the police  i m sure they ll get very excited about my vague suspicion  that s all it is  you should call them anyway  i found a new home for rosie  who  is it the right sort of person  they re a gay couple dad they re fine  well are they stable are they going to stay together  we don t want her ending up where she came from   don t you want her to have a permanent home  yeah  well she s safe here charlie  thought she interfered with your love life  hey hey hey hey hey  i said that she tried to sleep on the bed  lawyers should listen to the evidence and not make assumptions  what shall i tell steve and dave  well when do they want to take her  right now i could take her over there  i d want to know if she was absolutely safe  no let s leave it for a bit shall we are you coming back for lunch  will it be any better than before  i doubt it  i did speak to the housekeeper about a decent vegetarian choice for you  but she s from another planet  i ve got an early tutorial this afternoon anyway  i ll walk you to the bus stop i need to take her out  did you manage to get in touch with mrs mills coop  i left a message  she is appearing before you this afternoon she s for the prosecution  sounds like she s getting into bad habits  no that s fine i ve got to go   finish my tea  you re keeping very bad company these days  are you in danger of becoming a treasury devil  the cps doesn t pay much  but it does help towards the ever increasing chambers rents and clerks fees  we publish our annual earnings nowadays not like when you were there  you don t pick up your phone messages  some of them i don t bother to respond to  i don t know if i want to be your fencing partner  am i too good for you  you d soon get it back  you going to the lord chancellor s bash tonight  i couldn t think of anyone to go with  do you want to come with me  do you know what it is you want john  yes i want you to come with me tonight  ready to start  not without me you re not  the case before you is straightforward ladies and gentlemen  here we have a man of violence  a violent man  a man whose very profession was violence  this man in an act of jealous rage beat up his best friend  and put him in a life threatening coma  with a fractured skull and a brain haemorrhage  it s only thanks to the dedication of the medical staff  that john latymer is not now facing a far more serious charge  unfortunately the victim s recovery wasn t complete  and he s been left paralysed  partially blind and unable to speak  a perfectly good life now in ruins  the man accused of this grievous crime john latymer  a one time professional boxer who showed such skilful and calculated violence in the ring  claims he s not guilty on the grounds of automatism  that is when a person acts without awareness of their action  the prosecution will show  that when john latymer used his fists on alan day  his oldest friend  and the man to whom his long suffering wife had turned  he did so with premeditation  and with the intention of inflicting as much damage as possible on him  mrs latymer do you recall the night of the 15th of march  the night when alan day was beaten up  yes  i can t forget it  i thought johnny was gonna kill him  he wouldn t stop hitting alan  how was he stopped finally  i smashed him over the head with a baseball bat  if i hadn t he would ve killed him  he kept saying i ll murder ya i ll murder ya  that s when i hit him  the first blow didn t seem to make much difference  the second blow caught him behind the ear and he went down  i thought he d killed alan  he just lay there his head split open his brains spilling out it was terrible  well what did you do then mrs latymer  i tried to wake alan  i was scared to touch him  but then johnny started to come round  and i was afraid of what he d do so i ran out of the house  i ve seen how violent he can be when he came to after a fight  you mean after he was knocked out  no  johnny was never knocked out at boxing  yes that does seem to be my recollection  he drank heavily after a fight  it was like he couldn t bear to remember what he d done  when he woke up he d get violent  was he violent to you on these occasions  he was violent to anyone who was around  big al was the only one who could handle him like that  was he scared of mr day  no  no  johnny wasn t scared of anyone  alan had a quiet way about him  he loved johnny  he was best man at our wedding he even came on our honeymoon with us  were you having an affair with mr day then  no  no it was much later when it started  when i couldn t take johnny anymore  there was no one else i could turn to  only alan  who you thought your husband wouldn t hurt  yes  did your husband threaten to kill mr day  yes he threatened to kill us both  did you take him seriously  i thought he might do it   did you ever go to the police about these threats  no  why is that mrs latymer  johnny would ve hurt them if they came round and then he d really be in big trouble  you mean more than you think he might be in now  do you love your husband mrs latymer  no i don t think so  you don t seem sure  are you  no  i don t know  johnny s like a little boy  he wants to share everything he has  you can t help loving that part of him  you know he s hurting inside but he won t let you try and take some of it  do you think your husband s hurting now  probably  he was always sorry afterwards for what he did  always he somehow managed to suck you back into the mess  were you aware of how much he loved and depended on you  he had a strange way of showing it  was your lover making you more happy than your husband was  no  are you still with mr day mrs latymer  no my lord  i see  so everyone in this sorry saga loses  i think this might be a convenient moment  i ll remind the jury not to discuss this case except when all together  until the morning  it s hard to read the map of human emotions  the defendant looks close to tears but hitting his victim as he did  seems beyond all human reasoning  he s an animal judge you know the type  friendly and cuddly one minute then watch out  charlie would argue that animals don t behave as badly as humans  mr justice deed s chambers  jo mills judge line two  did my reasonableness in court impress you  not half as much as mr justice hoskins falling asleep at the bench last week  he used to be notorious for interrupting you know  maybe your clerk should slip you something  how about the lord chancellor s bash tonight  i have to go home and see marc  i could pick you up at six  i d really like that jo  6 00 would be fine   deed  yeah   station please  okay  find your own cab this one s mine  slipped your police dogs have you  don t remember me do you  as of yesterday mr romero what i had forgotten was how short your sentence was  i served eight years of a 12 year sentence  yes 20 would have been more appropriate  i should have walked away scot free i would have done if it wasn t for you  and let me guess now you ve come to get even have you  oh you re brave with all your police guards  as i recall your speciality was attacks on women alone in their rooms  it wasn t me it was a mistake  well the jury thought otherwise now excuse me i have an appointment  are you okay  me yeah i m fine  how can you be so calm  i felt like hitting him  most judges would have bounced romero right back into jail it s where he belongs  call the police  he hasn t done anything wrong as far as i know  anyway as a sex offender he has to report his whereabouts to the police anyway  you can check that he has  jo the man s a total coward   evening  hello  deed  ah sir john  sir ian  lady rochester  do you know jo mills  of course  my wife francesca  yes  you ve been the topic of conversation on the sixth floor mrs mills  or rather a couple of your recent cases have  i m surprised they interest you  oh nothing escapes the attention of the lcd  they were of a political nature  the cps can be bad losers sometimes  is the jury still out  i d hoped we d moved on is my car ready  oh you re not leaving are you  these things can be terribly boring if you re not a lawyer  well we ll talk about anything but shop  we have a flight to mexico for a junket in the morning  well the plane doesn t go that early darling  they have dancing at these bashes  can you dance  someone should stop him from making a complete ass of himself  how did he become a high court judge was the lord chancellor drunk  i assume deed is  regrettably not it might have been an excuse  somebody should stop him before he makes a complete fool of himself  why don t you she s your wife  well somebody has to  that was fun  beats talking shop  well i suppose we have to go  just as things were getting interesting  why don t we all go on somewhere together  i think not  how about you  if i were to badger you about bail for these two policemen  would you dig your heels in  i m not perverse and wantonly prejudiced  then you ll consider releasing them  i am considering it that s the purpose of the bail hearing tomorrow  did you see the times today  they were all but mentioned by name  no i read the potted version in the sun  i agree i think the police need all the help they can get  i promised not to talk shop  i m sorry  the home office would rather like it if you let them out  there s already a big enough problem keeping good people in the police  without the judiciary sending out signals of this sort  policemen like that are part of the problem not the solution  at least cross the road to us on this  there is no road i would not cross for honest hardworking policemen  do you want to come on somewhere else  i have my packing to do  why don t you hit him  you would like that i m sure  jo  i can t believe how you behaved  come on jo it got up ian rochester s nose a treat  oh that s what you were doing  you know the more powerful you get the worse you behave  no i have behaved consistently badly throughout my adult life  how would you like it if i propositioned ian rochester like you came on to his wife  i d think you got pretty weird taste  well i think you have pretty weird taste panting after her like you do  well i don t get much encouragement here  listen part of me has been in love with you from the start  do you think i didn t enjoy our affair you think i didn t want it to last forever  it s all the rest of it i can t take  what i was doing there jo was chasing a myth  a myth of love  love will make me feel better love will make me like myself a little bit more  it s not love and it s certainly not what women want  ah come on it s romancing  it s getting there works because i m there and she s there  in that brief moment we go beyond everything in our ordinary lives  for that brief affair i don t have a past  i don t have to sit on the bench listening to lies and excuses  i don t have to pretend i m not alone or lonely for an hour or a night  i can pretend it s love and it is we love for that moment  it s worth all the rejection you get and it s  glorious  am i overselling this  how many of the women that you ve slept with in the past year have you seen again  can you even remember  well you could change that   you could  no  no it s different with francesca rochester  you haven t forgotten her  you haven t moved on  i will be good jo i will  these two policemen my lord  are of hitherto good character i can t stress this strongly enough  they are exemplary policemen  family men  dedicated to a life of service  that s encouraging  i wonder if they d do as much if they weren t being paid for it  well would any of us do what we do without reward  i nonetheless urge you to release them on bail  for the sake of their families  and for the sake of police morale  oh i find it hard to believe that police morale is that fragile mr stafford clark  i can only repeat  these are honest hardworking policemen who would do nothing dishonourable  they ve given outstanding service to their communities  both of them have received commendations for bravery  this in itself speaks reams  both  i thought only constable fatts had received such a commendation  i do beg your pardon my lord  constable palfrey s record is so exemplary  that i i inadvertently bestowed upon him a commendation  i earnestly ask you to grant this application  the application is denied  unfortunately for your clients  this is just the sort of incident that the bail act covers  the defendants remain a threat to the well being of a witness while on bail  i invite you to return to this court with a fresh application  any time there is a change in circumstances  you d better not get caught speeding  i don t believe the majority of police officers support those two for one moment  some are furious with you for your decision judge  does row colemore want to see me  he didn t indicate he did  i ll go and see if the assault case is ready  thank you  all rise  with your leave my lord the prosecution would like to call dr david neale  dr neale was the first to examine alan day when he was taken to hospital  surely i m safe now  i should stay close judge  stephen  take rosie for a walk  go on  what a pleasant surprise my lord  what are you doing here  it s a public gym  i thought it was a private gym  it s open to membership  don t suppose you d like to second me would you  where did you get that  i bought it  are you gonna make that an offence   hello does she bite  yeah  hello sweetheart  hey rosie girl  if he s being a nuisance john call the police  that s why they re there  and you think the police will give me a sympathetic hearing  i m sure some of them will hate you but i doubt they ll neglect their duty  there s no point in calling them everything romero does is so reasonable  that s why it s so galling  i d say he s menacing you  ah it s women on their own he goes for  john don t be macho about this  he could be dangerous call row colemore  how rusty are you come on  en garde  good not bad   i just want to feel   safe in my own skin   john you okay  no i m fine  i could have killed you  but you have reason to believe romero intends you harm  i don t know  i don t think he s exactly got my best interests at heart  you should have alerted your protection officer  i didn t think it was that important  have you encountered this character  no i wasn t around sir  you should always be around otherwise what s the point  i sometimes duck off without him row  is that wise sir john  i think he broke into my daughter s room at college  would that be sufficient evidence for a conviction in your court sir  you re being impertinent sergeant  i apologise sir  he had a small doll and i think it belongs to charlie   i should hope we can charge him with that  just get them to investigate it  john  we re already under strength without his keeping two good policemen in jail  i ll have them increase your police protection  it s just charlie i m worried about  we ll put someone with her  dad you re worrying about nothing  may not even have been my doll i don t need anyone  perhaps you re right perhaps i m letting him get to me  keep your door locked   we ll change the lock on your door  oh dad  well keep your phone switched on  i ll call you soon  how long did the police take to respond to the call from the defendant s wife  to say that he was beating up her lover  we didn t have a car in the vicinity  that sounds like a long while constable  our usual response time is about 13 minutes   how long did you in fact take  about  about 50 minutes  where was latymer when the police arrived in answer to the emergency call  he was nowhere to be found miss   he fled the scene is that what you re saying  yes my lord  where did you find him  following a tip off he was found boarding a plane at gatwick for new zealand  was this for a holiday  no sir he only had a single ticket  he was fleeing the consequences of his actions is that your conclusion  yes it was  and how was latymer when he was apprehended  he claimed to have no knowledge of the beating he said he d lost his memory   but he knew who he was  yes  was there a medical report for the time the defendant was taken into custody  yeah from the forensic medical examiner miss  do you know its conclusion  the doctor said there might be brain damage consistent with a boxing career  was his behaviour consistent with someone who had scarring in the brain  equivalent to severe epilepsy  who suffered prolonged blackout memory loss  he was definitely out of it  are you calling expert evidence to confirm mr latymer s medical condition  i will be doing so my lord  it better be good  good girl aren t you here you are  here you are  oh you can t be that hungry rosie come on  let s get you out before you have an accident  rosie  god  call a vet quick  how did it happen how could you let it happen  well the vet thinks it s poison she ate some meat on the grass  i told you not to let her eat junk in the street  it s more than junk food that did this  i d guess it s some sort of dioxin  i ll know more when i get the report on her stomach contents  there s no antidote  we got her stomach pumped pretty quickly thanks to mrs cooper s response  it s hard to say how much got into her bloodstream  or what nerve damage there ll be  i d like to throttle the person who did this  it may have been put down for foxes or rats  yeah well i d throttle them anyway  what are her chances  if you pray sir john  that s all i can suggest  judge  all we can do is wait and pray apparently  where s my policeman  he s been recalled to the station sergeant bridges came in  romero has a receipt for the doll  i think that s who did this to rosie  well hadn t you best wait for stephen judge  tell him i ll be at the gym  stop it please you re choking me  coward you should be in prison for life  i haven t done anything judge  you poisoned my dog  she s convulsing and she s foaming at the mouth  maybe she ate shaving soap  sir john  are you all right  he s a madman he s totally mad  i wouldn t hurt his dog  i love dogs  you really mustn t let romero get to you like this  i saw red i really wanted to hurt him  yeah and that s exactly what he wants  wouldn t that look great on your cv  hm  think how pleased the lord chancellor s people would be about that  oh tell me about it  john it s been a whole hour and you haven t propositioned me  i don t know whether to feel relieved or disappointed  strange  i ve never cared much about pets before  they re a big commitment  like children  certainly find a way under the wire  better get the bill i ll take you back  charlie everything all right  how s rosie   still alive  good  i found one of the other dolls with the arms broken off  call security right now i ll call the police is anybody in your room   there s nowhere there to hide  call college security i m on my way   dad  do it chas  well there s no forced entry john  i don t think she imagined it  sneak thieves usually steal whatever s around  this isn t a sneak thief this is romero  romero went to the station to complain that you attacked him at the gym  we certainly had an exchange row  he claims you re persecuting him  oh he does does he  does have a witness sir he said you tried to choke him sir john  oh i wanted to break his neck  he thinks you re angry at him because he didn t get a long enough prison sentence  he didn t not half long enough  you can appreciate the police s dilemma john  it was him who poisoned my dog i m equally convinced that he s been in here   inspector ask the cid to do a fingerprint check  sir  yeah and check the other students and college staff find out if anybody saw him  they ll do whatever they can john  if you want me to do anything more you know where i am  charlie  your friend doesn t believe us  sure he does  mr crutwell how much had mr latymer drunk  on the day he made these threats against his wife and her lover  it s hard to say  you don t keep count  some of us do  when we have to drive  you had been in the pub about two hours   yeah  drinking steadily  we d had a few  had you heard mr latymer utter threats previously about his wife and her lover  oh yeah  yeah all the time  thank you mr crutwell  mr crutwell were the defendant s threats something you ever took seriously  not really  john is a bit of a loudmouth  thank you mr crutwell  that was my last witness my lord it concludes the case for the prosecution  thank you thank you mr crutwell  ms yesayahoo am i going to hear from you  no my lord i d like to call my first witness johnny latymer  very well  can you tell the court mr latymer how long you have known your wife  28 years  she was in my class at school  and your wife s former lover alan day  alan was in the same class  would you describe them as your oldest friends  from that first day at school  as you grew up you grew closer did you not  yes  we were inseparable  apart from when i started boxing  monika stopped talking to me  it was alan who brought her around  he told her the only way i could express myself was doing something physical  and when you married your wife did this change  no not at all  alan was still our closest friend  he did everything with us  how many other women have you known  none apart from monika  so you fell in love with the woman who was to become your wife  and stayed faithful to her  yes  was she ever unfaithful to you before going off with your best friend  no  what did you feel when you found out that she d gone to live with alan day  i don t know angry i suppose  i drank a lot  that made it worse  you drank a lot on the evening of march the 15th  do you have any idea what happened to alan day following that  he got hurt  bad  i ve got no idea how  monika said it was me  but i can t remember i can t  do you remember anything after leaving the pub that night  nothing at all  you were angry very angry mr latymer is that so  i may have been i don t remember  you d been threatening to kill you wife and her ex lover is that not so   i don t remember  you never once remember doing that  i may have said it  i mean we all say things like that at times  but i don t remember  isn t that rather convenient mr latymer  we now have your ex wife s former lover in a pitiful state because of your action  you claim to have forgotten this attack because of a crack on the head by a baseball bat  wielded by your ex wife in the protection of her lover  you claim to have no knowledge of this visit to your ex wife and mr day  because you were suffering automatism  isn t the truth in fact  that you were murderous when you went to alan day s house  murderous with intent and prepared to destroy and to get back your wife  no  i just wanted monika back  mr latymer isn t it true  that you went to the house with the sole intention of destroying the one person  that you imagined stood between you and your desire  no no  i didn t want to hurt al  i didn t want to i didn t want to hurt  in view of the hour  i think this might be a convenient moment   till the morning all rise  it s not often i have no clear picture of human behaviour  i fail to understand totally the loss of control that led to mr day s injuries  i don t know whether to send latymer away for a very long time or let him walk  well i think he s being manipulative judge  i wish i d kept the fraud case now   the police asked if you could go in  any change in rosie  oh she s hanging on that s all the vet would say  stephen turned up yet  well the police said they were sending a replacement  but of course one hasn t arrived  there were no prints at all on the dolls john and none of romero s in the room   your takeaway my lord  thank you mr johnson  then perhaps romero is more stupid than he thinks he is  charlie s prints at least should have been on the dolls he must ve wiped them  perhaps he wasn t there  is charlie okay john  say what you have to say row  well is she getting enough attention  you know sometimes children are disturbed by divorce  well how would you know all you got is wives and no children  she could be doing this herself  i mean the fact that only the dolls were damaged  thanks for your psychological insights row  the police have found nothing that would suggest any intruder  well what is it you d like them to do john  well what is it you would like me to do to get them to act  let their mates out on bail  well i can t deny it would be useful  row colemore thinks you re trying to scare me because you don t get enough attention  you re a little remiss in that area  well the police have lectures in psychology nowadays  well i hope you took notes  is your security around   they called by to check i m all right  good  anyone could have broken grandma s doll dad  one of my friends most likely  is rosie gonna be all right  she s a born survivor darling  i ll call you in the morning  bye love  dr dolven you are a consultant neurologist at st thomas s hospital  yes i am  were you asked to examine mr latymer to determine the degree  to which he suffered blackouts loss of memory  has it been established that the defendant suffered such problems  i m sorry my lord i m getting ahead  dr dolven can you tell us what you found when you examined mr latymer  the ct scan showed marked brain adhesions  did you form an opinion as to how these adhesions might have been formed  oh yes they d be caused by lesions that resulted from blows to the head  the damaged tissue fuses together when it heals  would this scarring result in blackouts of any kind  loss of memory lack of orientation  all three the scarring is quite prominent  yet he functioned with his cognitive facilities  his brain was damaged not dead  mr latymer has a highly developed sense of awareness of what he s doing   his drinking helps him to blot out  he would have known from the start  what he was doing  well the structural damage to his brain didn t lead me to conclude he wouldn t know   i mean emotional blockages are something else  thank you doctor  so  nothing medical explains the attack  no i mean prolonged juddering or jarring may exacerbate a propensity  it was clear from talking to mr latymer that he suffers from an enormous sense of frustration  well that s something we all suffer from doctor  what i m looking for in his medical condition or in his psychiatric condition  is something that would explain automatism  well blockages in the neural pathways that result from brain lesions  could stop mental connection with emotional response  if the frustration was severe enough or sufficiently prolonged  automatism in action could come about  okay thank you   ms yesayahoo  the brain damage he suffered  exacerbated his sense of frustration  and caused him to act in a way of which he had no awareness  yes that s the sum of it  all frustration results from a failure to express oneself verbally artistically physically  mr latymer wasn t able to express himself fully  the less he was able to do so  the more emotionally pent up he became the less aware of his actions   helplessly unexpressed emotions resulting from brain damage   would turn to unavoidable violent action   my lord  so  yes  i would prefer you to put questions and let the witness answer  i m sorry  with his medical condition doctor  could mr latymer have avoided the explosion of frustration he allegedly directed at mr day  he almost certainly couldn t  thank you doctor that concludes the case for the defence   do you want to come back mrs mills  no my lord   thank you dr dolven you re free to go  thank you  are you ready to make your closing speech mrs mills  i am  would tomorrow be more convenient  not if we can dispose of it today  yes  tomorrow would be more convenient  all rise   what happened to charlie where is she  i don t know judge she sounded strange   what did she say  well this is charlie deed i can t i can t  and then this man came on and gave me that address   what man  well i don t know he said he was a taxi driver   charlie wants you to go and get her  you sure it was charlie  well he did describe her i told him to bring her here  he said she wouldn t get in the cab  keep trying her number coop tell her i m on my way   did my policeman arrive  no nor his replacement  call the station send him after me  hello  sorry wrong number  hello  i didn t dial a wrong number who is this   where s charlie  you don t want to know judge  romero you are in serious trouble  tell me about it  where s charlie  in six feet of oily stagnant water  if you hurt her i ll kill you  well maybe your police friends will get her before she drowns  good afternoon mr justice deed s  coop call row colemore tell him to send the police  the taxi driver was romero he s got charlie   deed john what s happening  i hope your people are on the way   well coop had very few details  well she s got as many as i ve got  is your policeman with you john  you know he s not we ll get to that later  but you ve you ve tried contacting charlie  romero is answering her phone  you re sure she hasn t leant it to a boyfriend  forget it i ll deal with him  please my  charlie  please   please  charlie  charlie it s dad   please  charlie   i  charlie  i can t  charlie  this is charlie deed i can t i can t  romero  charlie  where s charlie where s my daughter  you re too late judge  hello  you thief you ve nicked my phone   charlie  dad you ve got my phone  are you okay where are you  i m fine i m at college  call your mother call anybody  why what s wrong  just call your mother and stay put  george channing  charlie this is a surprise  are you in jail  i just wondered how you were  that s very sweet i m i m just about to start a con  oh it s all right  i ve only got one coin anyway bye  how could he just disappear  did you hear what i said  i wanted to kill him  yeah well you didn t did you  he just got up and walked away  i need to talk to michael nivan  i called the ice maiden  why did you tell me to you knew she d be too busy  she s always too busy  she s got a big case on  john  i might not be afforded the luxury of resigning michael i tried to kill this man  i may have done the same if he d threatened one of my children  except charlie was safely in college  let me call the police  what do you want to do tonight  how about a film i d like to go and see a film tonight  yeah well there s that new cinema that s opened or we could get a video or  maybe a video  oh the police did send someone to the disused factory  no sign of romero  he wasn t a figment of my imagination  i m not saying he was john  put everyone s mind at rest have them locate this romero character  urgently  well if he was there he s in serious trouble  i should jolly well hope threatening a high court judge   get the local police to ring me at my lodgings  will do  police could find no trace of romero john  have they received a complaint  he d have to be pretty stupid  despite your deteriorating relationship with the police  i think they d still be inclined to believe you  he was trying to goad me into killing him  you re overreacting  that s what i wanted to do  is charlie okay her work going well  i can t put myself above the law  i m currently trying a man for behaving in an exactly similar way  i really must resign michael  it ll certainly make life easier for everyone myself included  at times john you can be a real pain  miss there s a visitor for you in reception it s your mother  oh tell her to come up  no wait i ll come get her  why didn t your father call me  i don t know  you two never seem to find common ground  he always seems to think he s right  i knew something had to be wrong for you to ring  look it s no big deal really  is there somewhere we could get a drink  there s a student union  student union that ll be noisy and sweaty  no baths are compulsory now  let s find a wine bar  i won i won  you cheated   i did not  you jolly well did  i suppose this is the sort of stuff your father does  oh no he s very stiff and formal  is he  he sometimes sleeps on the floor if it s late  you can stay if you like i ll sleep on the floor  i ve a 7 00 con in the morning  i ve enjoyed this evening  we must do it again  you know where i am  i ll call you tomorrow  i m going to remove my hand if you scream i ll hurt you  charlie charlie  charlie charlie are you all right charlie charlie what happened   where is she  oh she s fine john  the police owe you an apology  she was very lucky  mrs mills judge   john is charlie okay  she s pretty badly shaken up  who did they catch romero  mrs cooper tells me you re planning to resign  i think that s the appropriate response jo   so romero wins he ruins your career  no i did that  it s the same thing   think what i did  i did  and what it does john is it gives you greater insight  and understanding into violent behaviour  none of your contemporaries have got that  think about it  most judges sit on the bench totally divorced from the lives of the people they re judging  totally separated from the emotions that govern those lives  the most emotional response you get from any of them is i could murder a pint  you know what it is to be a man of violence john  you went there and you came back of your own volition  don t turn away from such a unique experience on an empty gesture  please  you have a trial to conduct  all rise  before you start your closing address mrs mills i d like to see counsel in my chambers  this is a matter of some importance so would you remain in court please  all rise  come in sit down a minute  i want you to consider an alternative to going forward with this case  this is a case where everyone loses  sending latymer to prison should the jury find him guilty  doesn t make anyone a winner mrs mills  well i m never keen on sending anyone to prison judge but he did beat a man half to death  if the jury is convinced by ms yesayahoo s medical expert  and accept the defence of automatism then he could walk  would you be able to persuade him to plead guilty  i think the jury may be persuaded to go with the defence we re running  yes and if they don t he faces a life sentence  if he were persuaded my lord  deal with him appropriately  would you be prepared to change the charge on the plea say   section 47  section 47  the cps will never employ me again  well sometimes you have to let go of the score  it s still a conviction  i feel like something s being taken away from me but i am open to be persuaded otherwise  then let s see if i can persuade you  as the defendant has changed his plea to guilty  it only remains for me to thank you for your attendance  would you return to the witness box mr latymer  i want to ask you some more questions under oath before passing sentence  remember you re still under oath  will you tell the court what your feelings are towards mr day at this moment  i feel gutted sir  well and truly  alan was my best friend next to monika  what i did is so bad it couldn t have been worse if i shot him  i took his life just the same  i tried to blame monika for what she had done  but it wasn t her fault nor big al s  first i pushed her away  and then i sentenced al to life  he never had any close family apart from monika and me  and now that she s left he s got no one  it s a life sentence all right  when did you come to this conclusion  it s all i ve been thinking about in prison  about how al is gonna cope now that monika s gone  anything else you want to say before i pass sentence  whatever you give me i deserve  well whatever i give you won t restore mr day to his hardworking useful life  yours was a senseless act of violence  it robbed this man of all that was useful to him  and until very recently i was completely at a loss to understand such acts  and much as i detest sending a man to prison  it seemed to me to be the only appropriate response  during this trial  i ve been given some sort of insight into the sort of emotions  that lead us to lose control  and so resort to violence  in your case mr latymer the affliction of loss of control  was compounded by the fact that you were a professional boxer  you d better return to the dock  mr latymer  if i were to send you to prison for 20 years would you think that was fair  yes sir big al got longer than that  the maximum sentence for this offence is five years  ordinarily the maximum is what i would give you  and regret that that was all that i could give  however i don t think you re a wicked man  despite your threats i don t believe that you wantonly sought to injure your friend  and there s my dilemma  i m not convinced that you would benefit from a prison sentence of any kind  now i suppose the press might want to comment on that  but i m not in the business of making good copy  but trying instead to salvage three ruined lives  if i were to ask you to nurse mr day and generally take care of him would you do it  yes sir of course i would  i m pleased to hear it  for assuming both the probation service and mr day agree  i m going to impose a community punishment order  under it you are to take care of mr day for a minimum of two hours a day  every day for two years  now under these orders 240 hours is the maximum  so i suppose somebody could successfully appeal this  but somehow i don t think anyone will  if my judgement serves this court and society well  then i believe that at the end of this period you will be keen to stick with your responsibilities  and so make enduring reparation to your best friend  that was the vet she said could you come  is it bad  well she just said to come  get my policeman no no don t bother  jo   i need a cab i need to get to the vet  get in get in get in  well done stephen thank you  i doubt if even 20 years would have improved you  rosie hey  how are you girl  i can only think it is your prayers that did it  thank you  thank you for all that you did  i was preparing to put her down  oh excuse me  if ever i doubted there was a god  this might change my view  well that s how you got some of your best results as a qc  on a wing and a prayer  i m sorry david there s no point in my approaching mr justice deed  it seems that he s reserved your case to himself and has no intention of letting it go   to me or to anyone else  well thank you anyway  i hear your argument why these two policemen should have bail mr stafford clark  my problem is nothing has changed in it the application for bail is denied  this in no way reflects upon the vast majority of decent hardworking policemen in this country  try me again if the circumstances change mr stafford clark  you know what will do it  all rise   you re too late  came as quick as we could  he s gone has he  about two hours ago  shouldn t you close his eyes doctor   we couldn t just leave the shop  it s for the best he was suffering  i ll arrange the death certificate  there s no need to contact the coroner  i ll take those  there is only one beneficiary in your uncle s will maureen  yes we were always very close  oh no it s his gp  he changed it two months ago in favour of dr bellew   what  you can t be serious what about maureen  dr bellew gets everything  he must have been demented  he was quite lucid when he called me in  maureen was everything to him she was all he had  what did he leave her  the cottage 20 acre fields  and about 300 000 before duty  you re joking  i m surprised it took her as long as two months before she did him in  i love this you know   dad it s awful  it is not  the first thing any court will ask if it gets that far  is why wouldn t an hiv positive mother want her baby tested  why doesn t she  if it s positive the doctors will want to treat him   well i should hope so  what even if he s well   which he is  that s for the test to show  kate says doctors have got it all wrong about hiv  she s managed her own hiv for 10 years without doctors or drugs  well then she s lucky  hiv equals aids equals death doesn t it  she works at her health lots of exercise a brilliant diet  healthy and pure no additives no animal products no alcohol  sounds like fun  can social services test the baby without kate s consent  if they could they would have done so already  you coming up to coventry at the weekend to see grandad  i ll try i ve got a stack of work on  persuade your friend to have the baby tested then take a view  we have dr bellew back  the prosecution couldn t locate the forensic they were after  good i like this doctor  she s very attractive  but that wouldn t necessarily mean she didn t kill her patient judge  my lord might i ask for another adjournment  in order for the police to exhume one of dr bellew s former patients  well i suppose it was worth a try mr phillips  unless you want to risk a retrial you re going to have to proceed with what you ve got  the crown prosecution service was convinced there was a prima facie case to answer  mr taylor you run a hardware shop  you sit on the local council you re a church warden  a life we might describe as a service to the community  if you don t work at community there wouldn t be any community left  you work many hours unpaid on council business  yes more than the shop probably  now just so that the jury understands  that you re not a man motivated by material needs  this is important  the murder on which dr bellew has been indicted  was supposedly motivated by greed   300 000 and the property the deceased man left to her  now i m obliged my lord  can you tell us what happened on the 15th of april this year  dr bellew rang the shop to say uncle reg was poorly  we d had similar calls from her  maureen didn t want to go over there without me  why was that  the doctor was often quite rude  she always seemed to be judging us  why was that did she say  she seemed to think she was the only one who cared for reg  we would do anything humanly possible  we couldn t get away when she called we were expecting a big delivery  well what happened when you got to the house  we found him dead it was shocking  your wife said that you d been expecting this mr taylor  you still don t know what to expect  his eyes were wide open sort of in surprise  was dr bellew still present  yes sitting in the dark   it was really odd  why odd  she didn t seem at all bothered  i mean she made such a thing about being the one who cared  she hadn t even bothered to close his eyes  what was it that aroused your suspicions  there were two empty phials of diamorphine  and a wrapper from a hypodermic i found on the bed  dr bellew snatched them from me and hid them in her pocket  hadn t you seen her use this drug before  oh yes she d use all sorts of drugs  but mostly through the pump in his arm  do you know if she had injected the drug before  no i don t think so  but i remember her saying that he was getting as much as his heart could take through the pump  i d pointed out that he was in pain  might i continue my lord  um yes  yet you found two empty 30 milligram ampoules of diamorphine  the autopsy showed a huge quantity of the drug in his body  this is something you discovered later mr taylor it couldn t have aroused your suspicions  no it was the two phials and her manner   her cool indifference to her deceased patient  yes  could the doctor have been upset earlier  that wasn t my impression your honour  what gave you that impression  might i remind your lordship that i prosecute the case  and mrs mills defends  and i m the judge  yes all right mr phillips  i believe dr bellew told you that a coroner s decision wasn t necessary  that another doctor would sign the death certificate  yes  did she say why she didn t sign it  no  were you and mrs taylor very close to her uncle  yes we were all he had  how often did you visit him  as often as we could  maureen couldn t do enough for him  so it would not be unreasonable to expect to be remembered in his will  maureen never once thought about that  she took care of all his needs  she couldn t nurse him he was in too much pain  she visited what three four times a week  i m not sure  or would once a week be nearer  once a month  i m not sure  why is it that neither the district nurse  nor the macmillan nurse ever saw either of you at the house  maureen couldn t bear to see reg suffering  it upset her too much   are you calling the nurses  i am my lord  mr taylor  how did you alert the authorities to what you suspected about dr bellew  did you go to the police  no i went to the town clerk  who is a friend of yours  we have contact in any council work  he sent you to the police did he  no not directly  he suggested i have a word with the coroner  who you also know  through my council work yes  and he appointed a pathologist a dr smith  yes and alerted the police  is that the same dr duncan smith  who carried out the initial postmortem on mr moore  the same one that sits with you on the council  yes it is  did dr duncan smith carry out the initial postmortem on mr moore  are you suggesting wrongdoing on the part of the coroner mrs mills  overzealousness as a result of a personal relationship with this witness  might better describe it my lord  the pathologist found huge quantities of morphine in the old boy s body  if you had grave suspicions as to the death why did it take you so long to report them  we didn t like to trouble dr bellew  until you learned that she was mr moore s sole beneficiary  we didn t do it for the money  i have no further questions my lord  what she did to uncle reg it s an outrage  thank you mr taylor  what animal is that what animal is that   is mummy being silly  brandon  is she   hello hello  is he laughing  steve  you can t ignore this kate  miss rankin i have something for you  i m a high court bailiff this is a summons to appear  why don t you go after real child abusers and stop harassing us  be sensible your baby needs to be tested  who says  he s perfectly well look at him  he may look fine now but he ll get ill   and what do you know about it  kate calm down  if you don t respond he ll be taken into care  just you try  tells you when and where to go love  you will never take him away from me  dr davis would you tell the court what drug residues you found in the old man s body  large amounts of an opiate alkaloid  almost certainly taken as a commercial painkiller  would the liquid morphine hypnoctol be the likely source  we identified traces of the buffers found in hypnoctol  the quantity would indicate a large dose   now what in your opinion would be  would you tell  would you tell the jury what the buffers in this drug are  you can t give someone opiate alkaloids orally they re too bitter they gag  they have to be softened and supported with other ingredients  those are buffers  why don t these show up in the same quantities as the morphine  they re absorbed at a much faster rate  faster than the substance that killed him  yes my lord  was mr moore receiving high levels of diamorphine for his pain  yes i believe he was  as much as  1 000 milligrams by infusion over a 24 hour period  i believe so  that s a huge tolerance  can opiate alkaloids accumulate in the liver over a long period with fatal consequences  no they don t build up in the body  they don t  can i refer you to a paper that you wrote in 1995   in patients with poor liver or kidney function   the build up of toxic metabolites and neurotoxins in the body   can have fatal results  did you write this  yes i did  can these metabolites result from diamorphine breaking down  yes they can but they don t accumulate  thank you doctor  have you since changed your opinion  the paper was to provoke discussion my lord  to get gps to question their prescribing and what might result  is there any foundation in the statement  it s a theory  most drugs are broken down in the liver within 24 hours  the metabolites are usually broken down in another 24 hours  do you want to come back mrs mills  not at this point  how s your friend with hiv  really desperate  she s been summoned to appear in court  hmm   she got a lawyer  no  she doesn t trust them  she s scared she won t get a fair hearing  i think she s going to ignore it  well if she does chas the social services will get everything they want  why don t you go to court with her  be her mckenzie friend  get real dad what advice could i give her  well you could always ask me chas  i m fine  you shouldn t have bothered john  you re not fine dad you were screaming in pain earlier  we ll get you through this dad  she shouldn t have bothered you  are you staying up  no i m in the middle of a murder trial   i told her not to worry you  i ll look back in later alice  i ll see you out  grandad  you promised you d come and see me in sussex  i ll get rid of this case and we ll spend some more time together eh dad   i told her  she s worried about you dad  he shouldn t have come rushing up here  he ll do what he likes dad  maybe we should take him away with us for a while  the doctor says he should really be back in hospital  i don t want to go there  i went in for a new hip  and came out with all this  i could barely get you out of bed and into the bath yesterday  i think you ve been wonderful the way you ve coped  did you tell him dad  don t bother about that  tell me what dad  we ll talk another time  when i m well  i m a bit tired now  i ll do that  you go and sit down  i haven t forgotten how to lay a table you know  what was it he wanted to tell me  oh i don t know  you ll have to ask him  my lord with your leave the defence calls dr bellew  i treated mr moore at home for nearly six months  he didn t like hospitals  he wouldn t go in  did his previous gp refuse to treat him at home  yes he felt the cancer was too serious  he refused to treat anyone at home  but you didn t mind doing home visits  no some patients respond better at home  were you giving mr moore powerful drugs  lots of them bigger doses all the time  with what object doctor  to manage the pain  hoping he d slip away  mr moore was in a huge amount of pain  yes it got worse as the cancer spread  what sort of a relationship did you have with mr moore  well  it depended how much pain he was in  sometimes he d call me a  a clumsy bitch a stupid cow   but you still kept going to see him  yes  why was that doctor  i couldn t just abandon him  how conscious was mr moore during this  well the drugs made him sleepy but the pain was so intense it didn t let him sleep  was he able to make conscious choices  yes  more drugs less drugs  okay  on the day mr moore died  can you describe that visit  i called in after surgery  late i had lots of other calls  i made him tea  he was in a great deal of pain  the diamorphine he was getting wasn t working  how much diamorphine was he having  500 milligrams bd   bis in die  twice daily  yeah a lot of morphine  but it didn t free him from the pain  no  i gave him an injection to boost what he was getting via the syringe drive  his pain got worse  so i gave him more diamorphine   intravenously  yes  finally the pain ebbed away  we had tea and cake  he was happy  he said i was his  best friend  wasn t it possible that you were his best friend  you saw him the most you were kind to him  it was the drugs talking  did you ever think of releasing mr moore from his pain   giving him a lethal overdose  yes  but then i d think well maybe he d get better  did you realise that he was dying that day  yes  which is why i called mr taylor  but you did nothing about it  he was an old man with primary cancer of the lungs  and massive secondaries of the bone and liver  dr bellew what happened after your patient died  i said goodbye to him  i told him i d miss him  and then i waited with him for about an hour or maybe two  until mr and mrs taylor came  so after your patient died you sat by his bedside for two hours  why wait so long  isn t this unusual for such a busy doctor  perhaps  but it takes time to say goodbye to an old friend  especially one who d left you all his money  when did you know about being left this money  well when the solicitor wrote to me  but the meals on wheels lady told us that you knew about being left this money  well before mr moore s death  no i didn t  well you heard her evidence is she a liar  i wouldn t have thought so  she said you told her about being left the money  no i might ve said that he wanted to  did you know about his will before his death  i think he said that he wanted to make it out to me  when precisely did you know of the existence of mr moore s will in your favour  when the solicitor wrote to me  but before that he d said he d leave you something but he didn t appear to be wealthy  yes judge  just wanted to clear that up for the jury mr phillips  i m so obliged my lord  did you tell mr taylor that there was no need to inform the coroner  yes it wasn t a reportable death  why didn t you sign the death certificate  i didn t have one  dr medalovich was nearby  why didn t you sign the one that he brought  i i don t know  the death certificate reads  death by natural causes  could it be that you didn t want to endorse the lie  well he did die of natural causes  how did you meet dr medalovich  we met in kosovo when i worked for the red cross  are you and dr medalovich lovers  we were in kosovo  while he was married  his wife had disappeared two years before  have you continued to have sexual relations with him in this country   my lord is this relevant  might be mrs mills  dr bellew  yes we have been together here yes  so you were lovers in kosovo  and you resumed the sexual relationship when he arrived here  yes but we re not together anymore  are you an honest and reliable doctor  i try to be  did you work at the mordiford hospital in birmingham in 1990  yes  and while you were working at that hospital  did you give a year old baby in anaphylactic shock  a massive injection of adrenaline into its vein  causing it to die of a heart attack  my lord  dr bellew was exonerated by a subsequent inquiry  the baby had a weak heart  i ve allowed the prosecution to put the question you can re examine on that  dr bellew  yes  i did kill little malcolm darlow yes  i think this might be a convenient moment  what s your feeling on this one coop  well i know what yours is you think she s not guilty  i tend to agree  where do you disagree  her friend signing the death certificate  she s human and she s busy  not too busy to sit by a dead man for two hours  clerk to mr justice deed  yes miss it s your sister  yes alice  he s lost consciousness john  the drugs are making no difference can you come up  i m sorry dad i ll come if you want me to  no no no you go to court with your friend who s she in front of  mr justice nivan  it s only a hearing about a hearing if kate makes a good case michael might throw it out  they can t take the baby away can they that s what they re scared of  she has rights just like anybody else  i hope you re right   oh there s my bus give grandad my love  will do  chas make a case  the doctor s only just gone  he s not sure how long he s got  the infection s getting worse  isn t there anything he can do  he s trying everything  dad was in such pain  that s what scares me  it just got worse and worse he was screaming and screaming  i d sooner rama gave him something to end it rather than see him suffer like that  the case i m trying at the moment involves a doctor accused of killing a patient  did he  she  it s for the jury to decide  i can understand why she might  it s terrible seeing him like that  he kept calling your name  the other day when you said he had something he wanted to tell me do you know what it was  alice  alice  oh come on  he should have told you  the longer he left it the harder it got  you re not his son  what  you mean mum had an affair  they adopted you  you re kidding aren t you  you didn t say why didn t you say  i m sorry  i d see you look at him at times and think  he must know  you were always so different  so clever  so questioning  well he taught me that  he used to back me into a corner intellectually and  say don t accept anything question everything  you should have told me  i m sorry  i wanted to i tried to so many times  he was always too scared to tell you  he was so proud of you going to oxford  getting the highest marks at bar school  as time went on he got more scared to tell you  he couldn t bear to think of losing you  he was afraid you d leave and wouldn t come back  he was my father you were my sister mum was my mother i  i never felt  left out  why don t you tell him john  that s all that matters to him  dad  nothing changes dad  it was a bit of a surprise i mean  it took you 52 years doesn t make any difference  might have done  when i was at oxford  for a while but  i don t know what i wanted you to be just  not a baker  i couldn t have had a better father  everything that i value you taught me  so um  i don t know if you can hear me dad but  thank you  have a safe journey dad  as we re informal in the family division  i think miss deed might speak on behalf of miss rankin and mr sarasy  also assist as a mckenzie friend bearing in mind the european convention on human rights  are there any objections from the council  the council has no objections my lord  when would the council want the hearing  the day after tomorrow if convenient my lord  there is an increasing danger to the baby from breastfeeding  the mother is not breastfeeding brandon my lord she never has breastfed  how long would the parents need to prepare  a month at least  the council would be obliged to go for an emergency protection order  to prevent further abuse  we re not abusing brandon  if we could avoid emotive language mr parsons  two days is as impractical as a month  i m setting this down for 10 days time  with the utmost respect my lord it must be sooner  there is a real threat to the baby  the parents need time to prepare mr parsons   are you seeking legal representation  no we re not  i think you d be advised to you must come back here on the 27th  kate and steve are concerned about who ll hear this case the judge s vested interests  what vested interests are those  well if the judge s immediate family were doctors  or if he took orthodox views on hiv and aids  or if he had say financial interest in pharmaceuticals  that s a valid concern  can we go back to how you came to be practicing medicine in this country dr medalovich   you came here in 1997  correct  and you said that you hadn t lived here before  correct also  yet according to the records of durham university  you were here in 1979  studying psychology  does that mean that you lied on your asylum application  i did not lie  you omitted to tell the truth doctor  is that because you were deported for shoplifting  i did not shoplift  they made a mistake  then let us look at your dubious credentials as a qualified medical practitioner  are you offering evidence to support this  i will show that this witness is unreliable in a way that puts a question mark  over the view expressed by his signature on the death certificate  unless you have evidence to challenge his qualifications i m not going to allow this  the witness has proved himself to be a liar  over his entry here as a refugee  well that s a matter for immigration to take up  i wonder if any of us might not make a similar omission in similar circumstances  dr medalovich  were you convicted of shoplifting in 1979  i did not shoplift sir  that s not what i asked  no  the authorities revoked my visa  members of the jury  you must try to disregard the matter of dr medalovich s possible criminal activity  i will deal with that in summing up  you can make what you will of the omission that he made on his asylum application  or consider his subsequent actions  working in an overstretched nhs and presumably doing a good job   mr phillips  on march the 25th this year  did you order a new bmw z3 sports car  correct  that was two full weeks before mr moore s death  how did you intend paying for this car  i hoped out of my salary  and what does a junior hospital doctor earn  not enough  well this car costs 27 000  is it not true that you anticipated paying for it out of your lover s inheritance  no  in return for the helpful evidence that you gave her  no  i tell the truth  then we must assume that your optimism about paying for it deserted you  you cancelled the car immediately after dr bellew was charged  thank you  mr phillips in my court counsel will ask questions not make speeches  further they will allow the witness a chance to answer  i do apologise my lord  well it s the witness to whom you owe the apology not me  dr medalovich do you want to comment on what he just said  she did not kill him  all right  do you want to come back mrs mills  if i may my lord i d like to call an expert witness for whom notice wasn t given to my learned friend  who is this witness  dr margot briones a pathologist who specialises in toxicity and sudden death  does the prosecution have any objection  we weren t served with a report  i have it here  my lord  the defence had two months to come up with this  he has a point mrs mills why wasn t the prosecution given notice of your witness  she was leading a forensic team in rwanda  well couldn t you have called someone equally qualified and more readily available  there is no one more qualified  is this new evidence that she will bring forward  entirely new  how long do you need for background checks mr phillips  24 hours would be helpful  shall we say tomorrow morning  i can t believe your doctor friend did that  did you know about the car  no of course not  well yes  i mean not that particular car i didn t know about that  but it s what he does  he ordered a porsche the moment he got his job  before that it was a mercedes  he finds them irresistible  did he cancel those cars  yes  he hadn t a hope in hell in paying for them  good  forget it michael  i m taking this legal seminar or i d do it  you re the most senior judge with family division experience  my daughter is appearing for the parents  only as a mckenzie she ll be able to see just how interfering you are at first hand  what me interfere michael  complaints from barristers are legion all off the record of course  no the only alternative is mary baker and her husband is a consultant  well why not trust her to be objective  i think the mother should have the baby tested  don t we all thank you john  not with my daughter they need proper representa  come rosie come on come on  would you take it pro bono  that s what most of it feels like working for legal aid  it would be something if they paid you in under two years  well the human rights aspect ought to appeal to you  little mother against the state  sounds like it appeals to you  would you like to come back tonight  oh john i love your persistence  it s so very reassuring  is that a yes  i ll talk to charlie  i was trying to help charlie you should have asked me first   jo was available  look just stay out of it okay   they don t want another lawyer they want me  you re emotionally involved  anyway it s now been set down in front of me  you still shouldn t have asked mrs mills  your friends should count yourselves lucky jo will negotiate a deal  get the council to settle for a non actionable test  they don t want a deal  well then they re very foolish at least talk to her  well why don t you she s your girlfriend  dr briones  are you the author of unexplained death a study in fatal pathology  yes i am  what is fatal pathology dr briones  disease of an organ within the body structure that leads to death  isn t that what all death is doctor  death is the cessation of the heartbeat  in reality everyone dies of a heart attack  fatal pathology is what brings it on  it could be cancer liver failure a stricture in the airway or toxins causing paralysis  many causes are not readily explained  would you describe your book as a standard text  well i suppose that s what it s become it s been a teaching reference for 20 years  in your book in chapter 5  section 3 page 157  stasis as a cause of fatal toxicity  you state that   when the patient is elderly and suffers from a condition where bodily function slows   metabolites are retained by the kidneys or liver with fatal consequences  does diamorphine break down into non excretable metabolites  in the elderly where bodily functions slow down yes  they stick to the molecules that form the cells of the liver and the kidney and can t be eliminated  have you examined the liver of the late mr moore  i did an autopsy  it s clear there was stasis in the digestive system  the blood the liver and the kidneys  his liver had been retaining large amounts of metabolites  from the morphine sulphate and diazepam he had been receiving  the huge doses of morphine he was given by his gp intravenously to ease the pain  combined with that retained by the liver  caused first the liver to fail and then the heart  can there be any doubt about that doctor  none  would a gp be alert to it  that would depend on how busy the gp is  most are too busy trying to help people get well  or in this case to ease the patient s pain  would a pathologist be alert to the possibility  well that would depend on the pathologist  we tend to be employed for a specific purpose  we re scientists but we re human and want to please our employers  but you tell the truth just the same  well the older i get  the more i realise there are many versions of the truth  i am asked by the defence team to examine a body  i try to be objective as i m sure the home office pathologist does  steve  kate  get your hands off her  you can t take him you can t take him  we have a court order to take the baby for his own protection  don t make matters worse love   no leave him you can t take him  where are you taking him  please don t let them take my baby please  if you come to the station they ll tell you where they re taking him  chas i don t care what sort of court order the council s obtained  they re not going to test the baby  don t be stupid they ll just do it anyway  well then i ll hold them in contempt  all they ve got is an emergency protection order from a magistrate  because they thought the baby was in immediate danger  and are you sure they won t just go ahead  come on chas have a bit more faith in the system  talk to jo  get her to consolidate both cases  i ll hear the new case and the blood test case in my court  i m not going to let anybody pull a stroke i promise  how s grandad doing  he s a tough old bird  he s hanging in there  i ll see you later  dr briones is it correct  that all death is the cessation of the heartbeat  yes  but presumably there are multiple reasons for this   not all of them innocent  yes by no means innocent  might one of those less than innocent reasons be that a doctor  administered a massive intravenous injection of diamorphine  knowing that the patient s liver was already loaded with metabolites  from the opiate alkaloids that hadn t broken down  that s hardly something for this witness to speculate on  no  my lord it is entirely for the jury to visit  thank you doctor  thank you dr briones you can step down  i d like to recall the home office pathologist dr davis  dr davis you re still under oath  do you accept dr davis that in mr moore s medical condition  the liver may have retained toxic metabolites as dr briones suggests  i accept it s a possibility  you see  you didn t say as much in evidence  now dr davis would you now accept  that toxic metabolites the by product of opiate alkaloids  built up in mr moore as a result of stasis in various bodily functions  and that this was the probable cause of death in mr moore  on reflection i would say yes  i d like to see counsel in my chambers  unless i get a compelling argument i m going to direct the jury to find her not guilty  oh no way  my lord the pathologist s evidence was credible  but not convincing  where are you unconvinced  dr medalovich the man s a liar   oh come on he s struggling for survival here  isn t that what most criminals do  he was expecting a sports car out of the deal at the very least  it doesn t necessarily follow that she was going to supply it  your own expert was against you there  yes i i must admit that was a bit of a blow  well i m not hearing anything to persuade me not to direct the jury to acquit her  what if the doctor pleads to manslaughter  forget it she d be better off before the jury  well she knew about her inheritance before the old man s death  there s no evidence of that  jo s witness shut the door yours bolted it  manslaughter  after all she did give him the injections  there is no evidence of gross negligence maurice  cps thought i d hammer her   they didn t see dr briones  exactly  i suppose i should have seen that coming  oh fine  fine let s give this lady a happy ending  she s suffered enough  judge i i would just like to thank you  god i m so sorry  i m   forgive me  no it s your counsellor you should thank not me  no no but you set me free   thank you  excuse me  well that should certainly get the lcd spies reporting back  maybe i should give them something to talk about  best not john  annie  laurence james  is sir ian there  i ll make this as informal as possible  i hope we ll all be civil to each other despite the informality  has counsel explained to the parents that this is a consolidated hearing  firstly about whether the local authorities should take brandon into care for his own protection  and then secondly  whether they can carry out a test to find out if he s hiv positive  the parents understand both actions  and do you understand who speaks for whom  miss wort for the baby and mr parsons for the council  and do you understand that these cases are entirely separate  and that one doesn t necessarily fall because of the other  if the council fails in the first case  they may not necessarily fail in the second  yeah we understand   but we didn t do anything to harm brandon  yeah okay  we ll hear that in evidence  is the baby here at court  no my lord he s with the foster mother  i don t think that s entirely satisfactory miss wort  could you arrange to have the baby brought here and given to the mother for the duration  but that puts the baby at risk  i thought i was the judge here  your statement presumes that the baby is at risk i ll determine whether he is or not  let s have the baby brought here  are the expert witnesses available  they are my lord  the parents have no expert witnesses but the mother offers herself as such  and to what extent is she an expert mrs mills  well as someone who has managed her own hiv successfully for 10 years  she feels herself highly qualified  all right  i ll accept her expertise on advice   mr parsons ready for the council  yes my lord  our case is entirely medical  we infer nothing about the lifestyle of the parents who are unmarried  the first action was entered in the family court  because the council felt it entirely appropriate to ascertain if the nine month old baby  of an hiv mother was infected  the second  resulted out of an incident reported by the baby s gp  she felt the baby to be seriously at risk  an emergency protection order was then sought  kate and steve are close loving responsible parents  steve is a computer programmer  and kate is a mature student reading theoretical physics  there are two central issues  first forcing a test on a nine month old baby  without evidence of illness  against the parents wishes  contravenes section 10 of the european convention of human rights  secondly we would argue that the mother s scrupulous maintenance of her health  in spite of this persisting medical condition  in no way puts the baby at risk  would you state your name and occupation  gail smith gp at the wayley street health centre  how long have you known miss rankin mr sarasy and their baby  approximately eight weeks  the mother came in to register the baby when he developed eczema  was it then you learnt she was an hiv positive mother breastfeeding her baby  and contacted the council  i don t breastfeed i told her i didn t  have you ever breastfed your baby miss rankin  no i couldn t  but even if i could i wouldn t  it wouldn t be responsible  mr parsons  my lord the council had reason to suspect otherwise  well doubtless we will hear these reasons at some point  can you tell us doctor  why you contacted the council about this hiv positive mother  i called at the home miss rankin shares with her partner one evening last week  to once again try and persuade her to have brandon tested  i found that kate had a deep cut to her hand the baby had eczema  i thought there was a real risk she could infect the baby with her blood  what statistics are available for hiv positive mothers to so infect their babies  i really don t know  do you have any other patients who have infected their babies in this way  no but that doesn t mean it couldn t happen  do you know of actual infections occurring this way doctor  only what i ve read in journals  i see so how did you assess the risk to brandon  i spoke to one of the partners in our health centre  is he or she an expert in hiv  no we re gps  would it be true to say doctor  that in kate rankin you found a highly intelligent young mother  who knew an awful lot more than you not only about her illness which she treats  but an awful lot more than you generally about this illness  she is intelligent  she s also arrogant and foolhardy  she beat 300 other applicants for funding  for a place on one of the top theoretical physics courses in the country  she is highly informed about health issues and the pitfalls of treatment  did you feel threatened by this superior knowledge  no  isn t that why you approached the council  mrs mills are you wishing to turn this into a hostile action  kate and steve feel that this doctor and the council  are being hostile towards their baby  and the council may be acting in a way that experience tells them is best for the baby  do you wish to say anything else doctor  well i didn t feel threatened  we tried to negotiate with her  you can t treat something as complex as hiv with alternatives as she seems to be suggesting  you can  yes we will be coming to you miss rankin  thank you doctor  i think that might be a convenient place to stop  my lord  is the baby to be returned to the foster mother for the night  i think i am honour bound to do so yes  how could you let the baby go back like that  chas you know better than to approach me like this  i at least thought you d be decent  chas please stop this now  great just give them everything  oh fine reason fails walk out what a perfect argument  do women drive you crazy stephen  all the time judge  a lady asked me to give you this  anyone nice  mmm  that good   you gave the council a really easy time  yeah charlie s been on my case already   i had an invite from your client dr bellew  ex client  you directed the jury to acquit her remember  i have no need to continue that relationship and nor must you   she s invited me to dinner  yeah well she can certainly afford it now  john it could be career suicide if you do   she was wholly innocent  yeah well that s not what the lcd spies will see   you d be playing straight into their hands  ooh  then maybe you should save me from myself  someone ought to   i must go  bye  judge  i wanted to see you  this is not a good idea   yeah but i just wanted to say thank you  you already have dr bellew  my name is helena  can i talk to you in private  deed actually met this woman socially  in the wine bar she s been sending him notes  it s a gross breech of judicial etiquette  he acquitted her on a direction  are we sure she is not pursuing him  to be certain we d need to have him followed  is that the only way  much as i d welcome deed s fall from grace  for his lordship s own protection  it might be prudent sir ian  that s to invite scandal of another kind  i d better take some serious legal advice on this  i would like to call dr capstick  it seems sensible my lord to have the medical experts together  yes that does seem like a good idea  the risk to a small baby of a mother infecting him with hiv mustn t be over exaggerated  but it is very real  is there any way of knowing if the baby is hiv without testing  we could wait until it gets ill from the various aids related problems  if the baby were found to be hiv positive  you would do what  treat him prophylactically with septrin and protease inhibitors  to do what  to prevent progression to full blown aids  thank you  how long would such treatment last for  for the rest of its life  to prevent as i said the progression into aids   dr capstick have you seen this baby  yes i have  apart from a little eczema in the form of a nappy rash he s very healthy  are there side effects to this treatment  the treatment you would give to the baby were he hiv  of course but minor compared with aids  do all hiv positive people develop aids  certainly not under my regime  there are long term survivors who we call non progressors  they have rejected treatments like kate  the sort of health regime kate rankin has adopted  is it likely to help her  fight the onset of any aids related illness  i believe she practises yoga meditates  has a healthy vegetarian diet and has herself treated with herbal therapies  all these things would help  but it would be foolish to suggest that this alone is enough  despite the apparent good health of brandon  you would still treat him against the mother s wishes  we do what we know to be right  isn t that medical dogma doctor  the exercise of your opinion against the equally valid opinion of the mother  the mother s view is entirely emotional  that s what mothers are like doctor when we fight for what we hold most sacred  the lives of our babies  ah ian i m so sorry  that pvs hearing took far longer than any of us expected  has frederick offered you a sherry  the health system is throwing up a lot of persistent vegetative state cases  science keeps the old motor running long after the ghost has left   thou shalt not kill but needst not strive officiously to keep alive  arthur hugh clough in the latest decalogue  now that these civil service examinations have become so risibly easy ian  i daresay you re getting a number of pvss amongst your own staff   oh yes sit down  thank you  we might have a little local difficulty joe  we are taking soundings for lords justice appointments  there is a school of opinion favouring your former son in law  what it can t happen  the baker s dust of his childhood has barely left his jacket  his liberal and humane concerns have resonated in the media  and in influential political circles  the lord chancellor feels he should be on the list for consideration  he s hardly been on the bench for five minutes  and well what have we seen  he uses our common law heritage  as if it were plasticine from which to mould justice  in accordance with his own warped notions  i was on the bench seven years before i was elevated to the court of appeal   i take it you re against it  no  neither i nor my brethren will allow deed to ascend to the appellate bench  his rise would precipitate discomfort in quarters well beyond this corridor  surely you simply have to advise that he is  unsuitable  ordinarily i would so advise the lord chancellor  yet i have reason to despise that wretched man far longer than you have  a newspaper recently referred to deed s judgements as   the law with justice flowing through its veins  what  a picture of an altogether more sinister character is what is needed  i take it you have some means of revealing that character  i have joe  what i urgently need to know is how sound my move might be legally  for obvious reasons i can t take advice from our people in the department  you intrigue me  that young couple must be breaking their hearts  give me a break  i got charlie and mrs mills on my back about this one  dr bellew left another of these at the reception desk   she s very persistent  and possibly dangerous  i ll alert security to stop her entering the building my lord  yeah okay that might be the best  thing to do  excuse me sir john  there is a woman at the gate asking for you  she says it s urgent  who is she  a dr bellew my lord  she seems rather emotional  yes she is very  ask stephen to deal with her will you  your policeman is off duty sir  did she say what it was about  only that it s imperative she sees you  i could call the police sir  you didn t leave her standing out in the rain did you  i cannot admit unannounced visitors my lord  let her in before she drowns  dr bellew my lord   god you re absolutely soaked  i m sorry about this  i m i m sorry  mr johnson would you get the doctor some coffee and brandy please let me take your mac  you know i could get into serious trouble just letting you in here  you really must stop pursuing me like this  i m sorry i tried not to come here  i thought i d go to the police or my solicitor but  you re the only one i trust   what i have to say i can t say in a letter  sit down  my lord sir ian rochester wonders if you might spare him a moment in his office  at adjournment  concerning what mr james  this is a matter for sir ian my lord  we believe it concerns dr bellew  then the mountain might have to come to mohammed  do they watch my every move what is it about me  do you really want me to tell you judge   mrs mills judge  thanks coop  breakfast in his lordship s chambers  do you want to give yourself a reputation  dr bellew came to my digs last night  well it was just a matter of time  lord chancellor s people know about it  what do you want from me a character reference  that is not the problem  well it couldn t get worse  jo please i ve had a really sleepless night  that s what you wanted presumably  she claims to have murdered the old man  it s not possible  she says he was in terrible pain and he pleaded with her to end it  his pain or his life  she gave him four ampoules of diamorphine not two   did she know about the will  says she didn t  are you going to inform the police  what for we can t try her again  they might want to dig up some of her dead patients  the lord chancellor s people think they ve caught you  in the worst possible circumstances with this doctor  was there such a circumstance john  no of course not  well then you simply tell them what you ve discovered  and there the matter ends as far as the lcd are concerned  what s your gut feeling on this jo  i still think she s innocent i think your direction to acquit was right  yeah maybe  john  what a dilemma  i don t know what s happened to steve  he had to go and pick up a recorded delivery  well he knows we need him in court with you  i want you to be clear about your evidence try to be calm and unemotional  how can i be if they take brandon  well you re a good mother kate all we have to do is impress that on the judge  i don t think they ve made a case about the risks  supposing he won t let me have him  it s going really well come on   kate  steve what happened  the letter s from the edinburgh health authority  they found frankie s health records  they want to know where brandon is  they ve contacted the local health authority here  but they can t they can t not now   i know  it s not fair   i know miss rankin   come on come on we can do this  yeah  hello  he s great  you okay do you want a delay  not unless you can delay it forever  thank you ladies and gentlemen can we take our seats please  the conventional wisdom is that if you are hiv positive and you don t seek treatment  then you are likely to develop full blown aids  why have you avoided treatment  i saw some of my friends who had it die quite quickly  they had all been pushed into the medical treatment system  i became infected from a blood transfusion so i wasn t keen to go back into the system  somehow i worked out that  if you treat a person with hiv without any symptoms it s like  it s like voodoo  tell someone they have a fatal illness and they ll almost certainly develop it  i don t believe doctors go about treating the problem in the right way at all  i don t believe they even know what they re looking for and then  when they think they ve found it they start bombarding the immune system  as though it were separate from the whole person  while that person continues to do all the things that compromise the immune system  such as bad diet stress bad attitude   drug taking  so you ve kept yourself in good health  yes i ve tried to i think it works  if your child were to prove hiv positive  would it be your intention not to seek orthodox medical treatment for him  he s not hiv  i know he s not  but if he were i would keep him well my way  miss rankin when you consulted a doctor on your condition how long did he say you might live for   10 years  how long ago was that  about 10 years ago  so to put it indelicately miss rankin if the medical prognosis is correct  you could die tomorrow  and your baby could expect to live about the same length of time  to put it indelicately you re pretty stupid   miss rankin i understand that you re feeling  he doesn t know the first thing  about hiv or related illnesses  you don t just drop dead there is a long period of poor health  i am not going to die and nor is my baby he is not  i have no further questions  thank you miss rankin  i think this might be a convenient moment to adjourn for lunch  my lord should the baby go back to the foster mother for the adjournment  no i think we can trust the parents over lunch  there s no other way out the nursery doors are alarmed   what about the loo windows  barred  the security doors are the only way out we have to do it soon before the court sits again  but they re watching us  kate we could lose him forever  how could you live with that if we don t at least try   i m scared  so am i  come on let s do it  kate there is a way to cut the ground right from under the council   if you agree to a test  no  let me finish  if he tests positive we can ask the judge to stop the council forcing you to seek treatment for him   under the human rights act  no we can t  well why not if you don t have to get him treated  one small pinprick and it s all over  they ll find out he s not our baby  what  you can t be serious  whose baby is he  the real mother died when he was eight weeks old we ve looked after him ever since   you mean you just took him  no  his mum died of breast cancer  i mean that was the start by the end it was all over her  i met her at the healer s we had brandon while she was in and out of hospital  we grew very attached to him  there wasn t anybody else frankie had no parents or siblings  i kept thinking someone would come for him but they never did  then i got my place at university and we came down here  did she will you the baby make you the testamentary guardian  well yeah sort of   she wanted to but she died before she could  that s not enough kate  you don t have the right to keep him  she wanted me to have him she did  i m an officer of the court i can t simply ignore this  you can t let them take the baby away jo you they can t  they can and they will  charlie i can t just unhear this i wish i could i have to inform the court  i m sorry  it s okay it s okay  you coming to see me  oh chas darling  come on your friend s evidence was very impressive  coop could you get us some tea please   well you re due in court judge  they re not going to start without me are they  i don t want tea thanks  well let s talk anyway come on  charlie you don t need me to tell you what this means  i m bound to sanction the child s removal into care  but no one could care for the baby like kate and steve do  do you really think foster parents would be more caring  probably not but under the law they have no rights  you can change that dad you can  oh chas  i love your optimism about what i can and can t do  and the law says if you re not related and have lived with the baby for less than three years  you have no legal claim  well how could they the baby s only nine months old  one right they might have is to foster baby brandon themselves  it s a start  but the local council has to agree   i can t steamroller through this one chas  why not  you act like spider man most of the other times  it s in statute is why chas  their not being the child s natural parents changes everything  when you found out grandad wasn t your real father did it make a difference to you  my lord  there s something i ve just learned that entirely changes the nature  before you go on mrs mills i m going to adjourn for 48 hours while i do some research  no my lord i mean with respect my lord the matter is of the utmost importance  well i fail to see why mr parsons with brandon in care  is the baby to continue in care my lord  yes i think that might be best but the parents are to have reasonable access to him  48 hours  do we have a problem that requires a stenographer  my concern is that the department isn t embarrassed  well be brief  it s come to the department s attention that you had at your lodgings last night  a defendant you had recently directed the jury to acquit of murder  well you ve got me bang to rights  you know that sense of propriety dictates it should never happen   the lodgings butler was present  the whole two and a half hours  she was observed entering and leaving your rooms  these were extenuating circumstances  she was observed passing you notes  i often get letters from people i ve acquitted  with whom his lordship subsequently has contact  these were exceptional circumstances   yes i gather she s very attractive  yeah a real looker  your department will be very embarrassed if i go public about your spying on me  i m trying to protect your reputation my lord  will you undertake not to see this woman again  nope on principle  i didn t think high court judges were answerable to civil servants now if you ll excuse me  i had hoped to dispose of this informally  i find this most regrettable sir john  my god this is a baker s son  you promised to rid me of him  thank you mrs laynen  these are the papers from dr bellew s trial judge   i ll get the rest  thank you mr harrison  thanks coop   could you  just get you some coffee  coffee   you look terrible  thank you   mrs cooper says you ve been up all night  i have   in a good cause  helena bellew  partly  i really needed to know did i get it wrong when i acquitted her  i don t think so  you saw her drugs records in evidence  you saw that she only signed out two not four ampoules of diamorphine  doesn t mean to say that she couldn t have got two more from somewhere else  maybe  i ve been reading about false confession syndrome  you know you keep coming across the same thing  people need to be punished they need to be seen to be guilty  well it figures with her  she told me she still dreams about the baby she s supposed to have killed all those years ago  the thing is john is that no one will ever know about old mr moore  so stop beating yourself up about it and move on  okay baby brandon  well if the council know what i think you know you re going to have to grant the care order  oh they know all right  they asked for an order without notice hearing this morning   well i hope you ll insist it s inter partes  no don t want the parents there  if they are i shall have to question them directly about baby brandon  john i hope you re not thinking what i think you are  well it s legal just provided i don t find against the parents   no i m not here i don t want to know  hang on   dr briones still in the country  i ll find out   we could just take him and run  kate we ve talked about this  we re fitter than they are steve we are  be sensible  hello hello my darling  you mustn t get out of our sight  it s all right we re not gonna run off with him  it wouldn t do any good anyway   we know about his real mum  come on   it s okay  steve  it is a matter of grave urgency my lord the council has reason to believe  that miss rankin and mr sarasy are not the real parents of brandon  it seems their reluctance to have the baby tested was merely a ploy to prevent their unmasking  they have since learned that the mother was one frankie mcwilliams  is there evidence of it  i have miss mcwilliams death certificate  and the baby s birth certificate  well all this tells me is that a woman died and a baby was born  that s why we must have a paternity test my lord  that s what this hearing is about mr parsons i had adjourned the hearing for 48 hours  it was a very fortuitous adjournment my lord  we will resume the hearing this afternoon mr harrison if you could notify the other side  meanwhile this application is denied  charlie wherever you are call me it s urgent  isn t she great   she s my daughter substitute  she s very beautiful  the doctor on whose behalf you gave evidence now claims to have murdered the old man  good heavens  well only she and god know  could she have killed him intentionally   did i get it wrong  no  she said she gave him four ampoules not two  the old man s liver was loaded with opiate alkaloid metabolites  almost any additional amounts of morphine could have caused fatal pathology  doesn t help me very much she could still have intended to kill him  i m a pathologist you should talk to a psychiatrist  i don t want to talk to somebody who s going to tell me what they think i need to hear  if it helps i ve seen this before  she s the sort of doctor who blames herself for anything and everything  i knew another one like that  in the end it stopped me being a useful doctor  a long time ago a baby in her care died  she was cleared of any wrongdoing  she still feels she should be punished for it   she substituted the old man for the baby  i ll tell you what i think  she gave the old man half a 30 milligram ampoule  and then another half then half of the second 30 milligram ampoule  then the final half  you could convince yourself that was four if you were in a state  hmm  you re a very unusual judge doing this  why don t you just move on  do you know you re the second person today who s told me that  well how many more do you need  dr bellew  do you know who this is doctor  yes of course  could you come to my chambers i want to talk to you  oh but i thought  maybe i m being paranoid but i think someone s following me  no you re not being paranoid you are being followed it s the lord chancellor s security people  hang on can you wait a minute  don t worry come to the rear entrance and i ll tell security  i wonder if you could do something for me  chas we have to move fast if i m to be spider man can you get here right away  mr james dr bellew has just arrived at the court  okay yeah  i m just going to change brandon  no it s all right she can t go anywhere   ready with your closing argument mrs mills  uh yes my lord  can you hold him for just two seconds  my lord the conflict hinges on whether kate and steve are good parents  and if by refusing the current test for hiv  they re shown to be lesser parents than if they had done otherwise  i m waiting for someone  i m waiting for someone  in actions such as this there are never any real winners  simply a ruling favouring one side  i m reminded of the judgement of solomon in kings 3  faced with two women fighting over which was the rightful mother  solomon threatened to cut the child in two with a sword  one of the women instantly gave up her claim in order to protect the child  and her compassion caused solomon to declare that she was the rightful mother  and he was recognised as a great judge  i m not convinced by either party s argument  whilst accepting that there are merits in both it is clear  that kate and steve are parents of the highest order  in resisting the council they have chosen not to presuppose a medical condition  that we pray does not exist  that is a wholly tenable position to adopt  it is not however one that i entirely support  the council for its part has acted honourably in bringing this action  though a few more hard facts to support their case might have been welcome  so i am going to strike down the emergency protection order  because it is perfectly clear that kate and steve are the right and proper people  to take care of brandon  but i am going to uphold the council s application to have brandon tested for hiv  as this current state of uncertainty cannot be allowed to continue  with respect my lord might we do that as a matter of urgency  how soon would you propose to do this mr parsons  well immediately the council does have dr smith standing by to take a blood test  then it seems sensible to proceed   can we take the child yes   i think she needs changing  she   it s not brandon  really  where s brandon  where were you i panicked when you weren t there   were you followed  i m not sure i was too scared to look  well it worked just like charlie s dad said it would  hello gorgeous come on gorgeous   ooh where s your mummy dad you were brilliant   you really are spider man  why thank you  kate needs three uninterrupted years of looking after brandon  then she can come home and make a care application  i ll reserve the case for myself  that s her   are you sure  it s dr bellew  would you return these with our thanks stephen thank you  yes we ve got him   when will you be back my lord  we ll let you know  it s not her  thank you  john where did you say we were going  le touquet for dinner  no john tea  let s try bournemouth i have to be back this evening  bournemouth i m serious  oh okay tea tea   just a minute lads  she can t be more than 18 where s the man who found her  over there   gerry  yeah  i m superintendent craddock  you saw the man dump the body an arab you said  car registration 321 d 520   you write that down  i remember numbers  did they find you any breakfast gerry   no  we ll sort you some out at the station  three   are you sure gerry  yeah  number three please stand up  i ve got diplomatic immunity you call my embassy now  would you stand sir  the gulf state s making all kinds of moves behind the scenes to free the driver  he doesn t have immunity for murder  but they are pressing the home office and the foreign office  your chief constable s coming under a lot of pressure   so am i  well it s gonna get worse malcolm  i ve been asked to review this case  to make sure the evidence against moncheri is sound  it is  all rise  i ve read the pre sentence report  do you have anything further to say in mitigation before i pass sentence mrs mills  indeed my lord  the police and the prosecuting authorities seem to have sought attention for themselves  in bringing this international footballer to court  it s hardly necessary to say that he is of hitherto good character  with no previous convictions  that isn t quite the case mrs mills  he s displayed the sort of aggression on the pitch that wouldn t be tolerated outside  indeed for one so young he s had quite a few red cards  the game is so different from that of life my lord  hmm i wonder  had he been a concert pianist or a pop star a talent of a less physical nature  i m sure we might all be taking an entirely different view   can i say something sir  yes i d be most interested mr armitage  well i just want to say that i never meant to hurt that bloke  i mean it weren t me who started it i was just having a drink with my mates  i never had an easy start i mean i ve had to fight for everything i ve got  please don t send me to jail sir please please  i note your remorse mr armitage and i m pleased to hear it  you are a public figure to whom many youngsters look as a role model  that is evidenced by the media attention that this case has attracted  even at 18 you ve got your own manager and a publicist to keep you in the public eye  huge responsibility attends such a position  when young people see highly paid footballers  extending their loutish behaviour beyond the football pitch  it sends altogether the wrong signal  or perhaps as you argued mrs mills  here is a footballer who is too young to cope with all the attention  and that to give him a custodial sentence would be to give him a double punishment  but these are the consequences of your actions when the stakes are so high  let us not forget that you seriously injured another young man  causing him to lose the sight of an eye  if young people see that you can t get away with it  then they will realise that neither can they  i think it appropriate that you go to a young offenders institute  for a period of one year mr armitage take him down  that s an outrage  yes isn t it just  all rise  mrs mills asked if she could have a word   with prosecuting counsel present  i suspect not judge  um  if it s brief i could see her before my meeting with sir ian  i can t believe you did that he has done so much for his country   he s a thug jo a talented thug  he is no different from a lot of kids today  he s a lad from a deprived background who made it and you have just taken it all away  a deprived background is no excuse  but this was a particularly cruel example to make  you re completely out of order jo approaching me like this   oh am i  mmm  well when should i approach you in bed you re talking to me like this  if this is gonna be what it s like john we are a million miles apart  i didn t hear this argument jo morning michael if you excuse me i have to be elsewhere  are we having dinner tonight  no john not tonight i m not even sure if i ever want to see you again   you mustn t take this personally  right now it feels very personal  i told that young man he would not get a custodial  then you misjudged the situation or the judge  i must congratulate you on keeping your nerve in the armitage case many mightn t have  news travels fast  laurence james tells me you re seeking another term at your present court  michael nivan thought there might be some objection from this department  i know we haven t always seen eye to eye but i wouldn t allow that to influence me  why is it i m suspicious of your cordiality  allowing personal feelings into the workplace is counterproductive  you re a fact of life john our working together is a fact of life  is there something that s likely to throw us together  we could easily avoid one another  there is a vacancy on the appellate bench   have you taken up my cause ian  the lord chancellor asked me to sound you out  he wants an altogether younger bench frankly i think you re too outspoken john  but it s a sign of the times  i wouldn t block your path  well i d be interested  delighted  does that mean you punch the same weight as grandpa  why do i feel so suspicious chaz  there are more reliable candidates than me  perhaps you underestimate how much they really need you  now the government s falling apart   is that what s happening  that s what henry says  he lectures in tort they need radical voices  if only life were so constructed   a few words on the judge s decision  stand aside  just a few words on the judge s decision  well quite unbelievable scenes here at highthorpe crown court this morning  after the controversial decision to impose a custodial sentence  on young football star addem armitage who was led from the dock in tears  hello it s jo leave a message and i ll call you back thanks  jo it s me  um  i ll try you again   his first night of a year s sentence behind bars  in sentencing the judge said if young people see that you can t get away with it  it s blanket coverage all over  laurence where are we with the trial involving the murdered tart in the skip   it s gone to the list at sussex sir ian  hmm  would you care to join me for lunch  as the murder trial is so politically sensitive  there might be some advantage in steering it in mr justice deed s direction  isn t that a reason for not giving it to deed sir  the gulf state continues to make representations via their embassy  threats over trade better describes what they re doing  the cabinet is split that s why the lord chancellor prefers deed  have we missed something sir deed is not reliable  precisely  with rumours linking the ruling prince s brother in law to the murder  we must avoid being seen to trade justice for exports  the accused is a low ranking officer attached to the embassy  he s either guilty or not guilty why would anyone care beyond that  unless the rumours are true and he s protecting the prince s brother in law  the home office wants no hint of a fix  the secretary of state for trade thinks we must salvage  the 10 billion plane deal at any cost  we still think deed s a risk sir  we mustn t let our personal feelings keep us from seeing the greater good must we   michael  oh john  john there are rumours about you and mrs mills  with her appearing before you well you know how this looks  i don t think you need to worry about that michael  oh  the tracey spink murder trial that seems to be coming your way  really i m surprised   yes frankly so am i it was on my list  well i can easily find something else  no no no i ve now had a rather complicated case in the family division brought forward   why isn t the murder going to the bailey  i think the lcd wants a low profile  yes we ve heard rumours about who did the killing  but we re not trying the prince s brother in law  no quite  do we know who s for the prosecution and who for the defence in the tracey spink murder  i didn t enquire judge it wasn t coming here  yes the presider was under the same impression i wonder why  i ll check with the list office  mrs channing rang to see if you were free for lunch  you are   yeah  george  does lunch mean that you re prepared to come down from your ivory tower  there aren t any decent restaurants within 20 miles  well how about takeaway at my digs this evening   i m after some legal advice john  all right fine you pay for the takeaway  brian cantwell defending  i did a judges course with him what a reactionary   so he didn t get to be judge then  nah he s a racist  there s a wonderful moment  when the interviewing panel ask you if there s anything you want to tell them  they expect you to remain silent even if there is  brian cantwell looked them straight in the eye and said confidentially  like it was already understood by them   well yes actually i don t like black people he said that   i m surprised he s doing this case  why is he doing it then   he s probably earning 200 ooo from it  oh  have you heard rumours about who really did this killing  sheik ali mazrui not his bodyguard  the jury will have heard those rumours too they ll want to try the sheik   when is the pre trial review day after tomorrow  i d better get reading  i have a major major conflict of interest john over my client and the government  if they re both your clients you have to dump one of them  the government isn t my client  but i don t want them wriggling out of their obligations  and leaving amco insurance plc stuck for vast compensation costs   you think you re going to lose do you  god forbid it ever comes to court  what s your father say  obviously nothing you wanted to hear  well he thinks we can rely on the government  what makes you think you can t  oh i see lover boy   the government s as guilty as amco  there s no question of guilt  my client didn t know the dangers of asbestos back then  well that s fine george until somebody on the claimant s team  comes up with a report that says they did   there s nothing to substantiate they knew  that s not the same as not knowing  advise them to settle  they d go out of business the ripple effect would be unthinkable  a lot of people lost their lives george  now you re you re talking to the wrong judge  with the secretary of state in your bed it should be easy for you  why don t you cut a deal george it s what you re good at  that s my dilemma i m getting married again  charlie said she didn t think that you and haughton were serious  she says that about you and jo mills  what exactly do you want from me an unequivocal position  so you can square the circle for your boyfriend and for your client  unlucky george  you re jealous now i ve found someone other than you  yes i can just imagine the pillow talk you and lover boy cut a deal for your client  and the people whose lungs are torn to shreds with asbestos can go to hell  you re insufferable why i still bother with you  oh bad luck  my lord from the defence s inquiries into the main prosecution witness  we feel obliged to object to gerry hewitt  this is a very unstable witness  were he to be admitted and were a conviction to follow  a grave injustice might result  mr hewitt is an itinerant  who has been in and out of mental institutions all his adult life  perhaps they cured whatever problem he had mr cantwell  then let us put that aside as one can deal with it in cross examination  our main objection is that this witness has for the past four months  been residing at a police station  doubtless being coached in his testimony as well as he is being fed  do you have evidence of this mr cantwell  of his being well fed my lord  i believe he has put on a stone in weight on his current regime  perhaps that might go to explain why we see so many overweight policemen  my lord the police believe that without protective custody  mr hewitt would disappear and not merely because he is an itinerant  he is an important witness and without him  the family of the murdered girl would have little chance of seeing justice  for their daughter s murder  whilst living with the police he is free in all respects  and having made a statement of course  it is forbidden for any police officer involved in the case  to discuss the case with him or to try to influence him  does he have any particular condition  that would make him subject to influence from the police mr thorp  no my lord he has a schizoid condition which has been under control for some time now  hmm  well it seems to me that one of the purposes of a trial by jury  is to examine exactly the sort of issues that have been raised by mr cantwell  i will listen carefully for any hint of undue police influence in his testimony  so if the arguments are done i d like to get on with selecting a jury  kathleen mccracknel peter symmonds   michael maynard  i m michael maynard  ah i misheard sorry  perhaps you d swear our jury mr harrison  we might hear some of your opening address mr thorp  ali abdul moncheri  the names you are about to hear are the jurors who will try you  if you wish to object to any of them  then you must do so as they come to be sworn in and your objection will be heard  he phoned a couple more times it was only then  that he was put through so i just wanted to call him back   you all right beswick  yes i think so   you sure  yeah   oh  beswick are you all right  can you breathe all right  i regret to have to inform the court that mr thorp was taken ill yesterday  i heard it was beef curry  will you be opening mr burroughs  with respect my lord could we postpone until i find out when mr thorp is to return  my lord while sympathising with my learned friend  i hope his indisposition won t push us into protracted delay  my client s been in custody four months on a charge he strenuously denies  yes i know how mr moncheri must be suffering on remand mr cantwell  let us hope that mr thorp makes a full and speedy recovery  right we will adjourn while you consult with the cps  to see if they want a postponement or to appoint a replacement leader  but in fairness to the defence we should avoid a protracted delay  i m obliged my lord   oh you re early i ll have a quick shower  john beswick thorp has died  what   what happened  his heart stopped  i thought it was food poisoning is it suspicious  i m a policeman john  we re looking to see whether his death was connected with the case he was prosecuting  his wife says he d had strange phone calls but dismissed them  he was treasury counsel  prosecuted murderers and major crims all the time  we advised sussex police to provide maximum security  no  armed policemen would put altogether the wrong emphasis on this case  your defendant has powerful friends john  anything less than blanket security might endanger the next prosecutor   well who is he i ll have a word with him  cps has informed us it s jo mills  give her armed protection outside but i don t want to see any guns in the courtroom   are you ready with the prosecution jo  it feels a bit like drowning but yes  and you have been told of the security risks  under the circumstances you re not obliged to go ahead  in which case someone else would be at risk  unless of course you intend to conduct the prosecution  heavy security would send the jury the wrong signal  there won t be any brian just jo s protection policeman and court people  very good lunch   why don t you return my calls  i ve been busy  that s very last century i was calling to say be careful  the police are suspicious about beswick thorp s death  it seems that some of your jury  have been approached by one of the panel who wasn t selected   with any sinister result  who knows at least they reported it  it s an important murder trial  people up for jury service would want to be in on it  this person was trying to find out the names and addresses of other members of the jury  has he been charged i ll deal with him at the end   it s a she a very attractive she  hmm  good job she didn t approach you then  why are you involved it s not a london case  oh because of the defendant s diplomatic status  i m liaising between sussex and the special branch  one of them had 5 ooo put into his account from a bank in the caymans  i assume we didn t get him  they ve lost a juror judge   what another one  this one was taken ill  how   do we know what s wrong with mrs fergusson  some kind of food poisoning my lord  based on current form i don t want to continue with only 11  let s reselect the jury from the existing 11 plus a couple of extras and re swear them  michael mason take the book in your upraised hand  right or left is immaterial and read the oath on the card   i swear by almighty god that i will faithfully try the defendant   and give a true verdict according to the evidence  thank you mr mason now we have a full jury once more  i should instruct you not to eat or drink for the whole of this trial  you think i m joking  we will show that the man in the dock killed tracey spink  a young woman who ran away from home at 15  and eventually fetched up in brighton working for an escort agency  it was here that the defendant first encountered the dead girl  on the night in question  he picked her up in a nightclub and took her to a hotel  where he with another unknown tied her up  then with a gag in her mouth and a ligature about her throat  had sex with her several times  it was during this act and as a part of the sexual experience  that tracey spink slowly choked to death  a condom was used so as to leave no trace of himself inside her  however what the defendant did leave behind after dumping her body  was one single hair that has been dna matched to hair from his forearm  additionally we will show that the body of tracey spink  was transported in the defendant s diplomatic car in the boot  where traces of her skin were found   promise me to behave yourself  oh dear is my tie straight  charlie darling be an angel  and make sure grandpa doesn t leave cigarette ends on the veranda  this is a meeting i m not sure i can handle  georgia darling you handle everything so perfectly  the pm s taken quite a shine to her   neil haughton  the former mr george channing  is that what i have to look forward to darling  i m just going to make sure everybody s got drinks   she does it all so elegantly  yes and so often  what do ex and future husbands talk about car routes   is that cabinet small talk  mostly about 5 isn t   charlie tells me you have a high profile case on is that all she told you  what do you do about the rumours that the real murderer was the prince s brother in law  the only thing i can do have the gossips tongues cut out  can you  it might help us secure that 10 billion plane order  i thought it had gone to the french  you don t want to believe everything you read in the papers  it d be a different sort of trial if i did   i m not convinced there should even be a trial  then you re not the prosecuting authority  no i help keep the country afloat with exports   well i suppose somebody s got to  i know what s good for britain john  we could still pull this plane order out of the fire  not while this trial is underway  you and george should be very happy you seem ideally suited   what s that meant to mean  you share her scant regard for due process   my concern is for the greater good  ah  there s a rock upon which fairness and justice have become arid to the point of death  what about justice and fairness for the people whose jobs this order would secure  pride and self righteousness never put bread on the table   how are you two getting on  we re finding common ground   were you telling neil all about my bad habits  i wouldn t believe him darling  i have to go i ve got a lot of reading to catch up on  mr hewitt i m sure my learned friend for the defence  will question you as to how you came to be in the alley  when you saw the defendant dump tracey spink s young body into the skip  would you now tell the court why you were there  i was sleeping there you know  i sometimes sleep there that s a good spot set back out of the draught like   could you see the skip  i could see it yeah  i was across the other side of the alley and down a bit  how often do you stay in this alleyway  once twice a week i was robbed miss yeah  and that s a good spot like  is there any doubt in your mind as to who you saw  on the morning of january 29th of this year dump the body in the skip  no i saw him it was that man   you re completely sure of that  yeah i saw him   did you see the car he was driving  yeah 321 d 520   and you re sure of that  yeah i remembered and told the police   thank you mr hewitt perhaps you d stay there  all right  mr hewitt are you sure the man you picked out was the same one you saw in that dark alley   yeah that was him  it was dark in that alleyway was it not   yeah  very dark  yeah but it was him i saw the car number  that s how the police found him ain t it  you don t have very good cognitive powers do you mr hewitt   i don t know  oh i think you do  when you were subjected to psychological tests and shown pictures of people in different contexts  you scored only 20 or 30 did you not   i don t know  my lord   are you offering these findings mr cantwell  i will be my lord  they show how little reliance can be placed upon this witness   you don t have a very good memory do you  well i  i think it s all right yeah  do you remember what you had for breakfast at the police station this morning  i had grapefruit porridge poached eggs on toast tea four cups of tea  the police are treating you very well mr hewitt you re living with the police   yeah i i don t want to let them down  why is that mr hewitt   it s a very important case this ain t it  who told you it was  the police did   would you lie to help the police  no  are you sure wouldn t you distort the truth  pretend to see something you hadn t when memory fails  no i wouldn t do that  your memory does fail mr hewitt yes   no no  do you remember your mother mr hewitt  mmm  do you remember her  or when you last saw her mr hewitt  mr hewitt  are you able to answer the question mr hewitt  the witness is clearly having some difficulty  i think this might be a convenient moment to give him time to recover himself  all rise  you will get on tomorrow miss peters  just as long as he gets what s coming  your evidence is very important thank you  yeah well i liked tracey i mean it could have been any of us   yeah  did you just call me   you called me  oh i made a mistake i m sorry   jo are you all right  i m just working too late  someone phoned and then put the phone down on me  is your policeman around   i m at chambers  is he there you must tell him   no it was probably a wrong number  jo you must stop work and go home  should i good night john  row sorry if i woke you  morning john   sussex police have put a monitor on jo s phones  i hope she knows   beswick thorp was murdered john  oh no  how do we know who did it  mr hewitt i trust you ve now sufficiently recovered to remember your mother  is it not true that four years ago you approached three separate women  in eastbourne in woolworths insisting that each was your mother  was that not a repeat of your mental breakdown  you did have a mental breakdown at that time mr hewitt  for which you were treated at hastings mental hospital  part of that treatment was electroconvulsive therapy  you had ect on no less than 27 occasions  did that actually improve your memory or make it worse  didn t you tell the doctor that your memory was shot to pieces  not only could you not remember your mother you didn t know who you were  i don t think they should have given me that treatment  it badly affected your memory did it not   but did it affect his cognitive powers  i would suggest it did my lord  i would direct your lordship to the result of hospital tests on mr hewitt  for his cognitive powers and memory following treatment  21 c in bundle k   they show how low he scored  my lord  yes yes i ve read it  how did you obtain these confidential records  my lord  would the jury go out please   well mr cantwell  they were obtained by our investigators  how was that mr cantwell  my lord you know very well from your days as a barrister  most investigators are retired policemen with a network of contacts  and you know full well that if you had wanted such tests  you would need to seek the cooperation of the prosecution  they would have given that cooperation  my lord these records are a matter of fact  mr cantwell the moment we begin to admit evidence  that has been obtained in violation of the law  the whole moral legitimacy upon which the legal system is founded begins to crack  the end does not justify the means in this process  if it did we might just as well torture everybody suspected of a crime  under section 78 of the police and criminal evidence act 1984  and you know the section  the court may exclude evidence if it appears that  having regard to all the circumstances including those under which it was obtained  its admission would have an adverse effect i m going to exclude it  mr craddock i didn t know he was going to sweep up my past i didn t know  no of course you didn t gerry you did your best   i can t stay at the police station no more can i  social services will sort you out  here you go  what is it  what is it  let go let go of it  moncheri   where did you get this  he dropped it in the alley  you know the rules on late evidence as well as i do   we can t introduce it  you could talk to the judge  brian  on the face of it the wallet is pretty damning evidence  if you believe hewitt found it in the alleyway  i m not inclined to  more likely he stole it and identified moncheri from this photo  you could test that before the jury  i could let jo recall her witness and testify to the wallet  i m not inclined to do that  we can t introduce this evidence unless the defence agrees  sorry  you can cross examine my client on it in due course  oh i will brian  jo  with your leave my lord i was to have called maev peters  a work colleague of tracey spink regrettably she hasn t appeared  mrs mills is this carelessness  on the list of witnesses for the prosecution there was a policeman from diplomatic protection  he was to have given evidence before miss peters like her he s failed to show up  where are they  the policeman is in australia on government business  well i want a very good reason why he s in australia  or i ll hold him and his superiors in contempt they know better  what about miss peters is she ill  i m instructed that she has also left the country  oh is this on behalf of the government  i believe it was to take a job in the middle east  well then she is another one likely to see the inside of a cell  unless something suggests she was induced not to give evidence   my lord this is a most unwise speculation  i fail to see how mr cantwell with the jury out  these things have a way of filtering back to them  yes yes yes is your next witness here  he is my lord the assistant manager at browns hotel brighton  good let s have the jury in and proceed  mr cooper were you on duty as assistant manager at your hotel  between the 26th and the 31 st of january this year  yes i was  can you look in your bundle marked k and find the item marked 3k  is that a computer printout of your guest register  yes it is  for the days the 27th the 28th and 29th for the penthouse suite   can you tell us who was staying there  no one  was not sheik mazrui of the gulf state staying at your hotel  no he had checked out with his staff on the 27th  my lord may i have permission to treat this witness as hostile   any objection mr cantwell  no  very well   is that your statement mr cooper  yes i know i said he was there  he had in fact reserved the suite in case he came back  but i made a mistake   you made a mistake  yes  you waited until now to correct it  yes the computer had a glitch not the first time   how often does this happen mr cooper  quite often sir  mr cooper i put it to you that you are a liar who is perjuring himself for gain   no i m not  the jury will make up its own mind about that  superintendent craddock  did you at any time have cause to visit anyone at browns hotel brighton  during the month of january  think carefully because i don t want you to make a mistake  yes i went to see sheik ali mazrui having identified a gulf state embassy car  that was at the disposal of his driver for his visit to britain   and do you know what day that was  yes on 30th of january  and can you tell us who was present  the defendant the sheik his personal assistant my sergeant  and mr cooper the hotel assistant manager who conducted us to the penthouse  mr cantwell  superintendent craddock you ve a good memory for dates  i d say i do it s something you develop  are you the former detective inspector craddock  who in 1992 arrested an egyptian diplomat for breaking his wife s arm  you must answer  yes i am  the man was discharged from court can you tell the jury why  there was a mix up over when he was in the country  another mix up  you said it was may the 15th  in fact mr yasser was out of the country was he not  he lied   you didn t make a mistake  he lied and so did the embassy people   sir ian rochester judge  thanks coop   would you like some tea  how pleasant  i ve never taken tea in chambers  the prosecution seems under heavy weather with its main witness collapsing  and its witnesses disappearing  a lot of pressure is being put on this case  mightn t it be politically expedient to direct the jury to acquit   would that get the plane order back  it might help  hmm  this plane order seems to dominate everything  i wouldn t presume to suggest what you do john  i came to tell you that the consensus of the appellate bench favours your appointment  my position regarding this trial hasn t changed  that s what makes you so interesting to the lord chancellor  but neither he nor any other government minister  can ignore the fact that over the next four years there could be guaranteed employment  for over 5 ooo aerospace industry workers  mostly in places of high unemployment coventry bristol south wales  i wonder how many of those people would set aside that length of employment  for what might prove to be an empty gesture   lf you trust people they might surprise you  the government did it had an election  now it not the people has to manage the economy  i have a clear sense of conviction about my actions  conviction is the prerogative of those who don t have to bother with everyday economic reality   i see it as the basis of a fair and decent society  one has to live with economic reality   we re all the poorer for it ian  that s my point  we can t try sheik ali mazrui vicariously which is what everyone seems to be attempting  what we re attempting is justice for the murdered girl and her family  without justice we have no country no society  no position of authority  keep this up and they won t appoint you   i can t play their games chaz  well you could at least pretend to  the risk there is to lose sight of where pretence ends and distorted principles begin  no no the real risk is that you drift to the right without even noticing   is that what you think s happening  it s what neil says  he thinks you don t care about all the people needing jobs  i ll trade principles with lover boy any day of the week  mr rose might i have a word please in private   we re about to go into court can it keep  it s important  one of the jurors was bribed  mr symmonds it s come to my attention that you were approached  by a member of the public in an attempt to influence your decision   why didn t you tell the court  i didn t want to be taken off the jury   well that s what s bound to happen now  i didn t take his money  i said i wouldn t do it  it s your keeping quiet that concerns me   you ve put this entire trial in jeopardy  i m very sorry sir  let s try and remedy the situation by apprehending the person who approached you  go with the jury bailiff for now you ll be kept apart from the other jurors  it must be a record number of attempts to interfere with a trial   i m determined to continue  can we  in the circumstances  unless i hear a convincing argument to the contrary  i m gonna carry on with 11 jurors  they will doubtless assume in the juror s absence  it was my client s doing  no why he was separated from the others first thing   it s still a grave risk  what are your thoughts jo  there is a risk that any conviction will be rendered unsound  but i don t see how we avoid the same thing happening if we go for a retrial  i could put the jury under 24 hour guard  or abandon the case altogether and direct the jury to acquit  no the defendant must answer it if there is to be any justice for tracey spink  are you arguing that as a barrister or as a woman  i won t dignify that with a response  my lord might we have a word   i have another appointment mr james  we ll be brief my lord  it is thought in the circumstances it might be unsound to proceed  you might either instruct the jury to acquit or go for a retrial my lord  who thought you sir ian the lord chancellor  it is essential my lord in these circumstances that we are seen to do things correctly  it s essential to do things correctly in all circumstances mr james  the procedure is correct   a conviction here would be unsound my lord  you re assuming that there will be one  your lordship seems determined to ensure there is  no your lordship is determined to ensure a just outcome  i know that a lot depends economically upon the outcome of this trial  a concerted effort has been made to derail us it s not going to happen  5 wells yard  jo mills please   may i ask who s calling sir  it s john deed here  oh hello sir just a moment sir   oh didn t kevin give you my message  yeah you re in conference  i came to apologise for my insensitive remark  it s a long way to come it was unimportant   it didn t seem unimportant this afternoon  that was this afternoon  i have a lot of work  yeah i m having a meeting with your head of chambers   can we have dinner afterwards  no we can t  jo can t we go back to the way we were before i sent armitage down  these are   thanks  i ll see you in court tomorrow  with the complex checks and counterchecks that take place in police laboratories dr jannatie  do mistakes of cross contamination never take place  i can t say never there s a human element humans are fallible  so it is conceivable that the hair purported to have come from the defendant  and found on the dead girl  could have strayed from the batch you took for testing  it s just conceivable  then it is conceivable that the skin found in the boot of the car  wasn t there at all  i ll accept that forensic might make one mistake but two mr cantwell  we are exploring possibilities my lord   how old was the skin dr jannatie  i don t know precisely  it was not more than two weeks old  so she could have been in the boot of the car for any time up to two weeks  prior to when the prosecution say the body was dumped  yes  this skin being dead will have dropped off something  possibly the sheet in which she was wrapped  yes  equally possible then that it was from a coat or a hairbrush  placed in the boot at an earlier stage   it s possible  thank you  do you wish to re examine mrs mills  if it was skin from the victim s coat or hairbrush would you be able to tell  there would be hair follicle parts mixed with it   were there any such particles  no  did any cross contamination of samples take place in the lab or elsewhere  no i m certain it didn t   thank you doctor you can step down doctor  in the absence of mr reeves  the policeman from the diplomatic squad who is still in australia and miss peters  dr jannatie was our last witness my lord   that concludes the case for the crown  mr cantwell  with your leave my lord i would like to call the first witness for the defence  mr hussain husaini  mr husaini is in charge of the motor pool at the gulf state embassy  where the car identified in the alleyway on the night of the 29th was garaged   are you not calling the defendant  no my lord  your client fully understands that the jury  may draw an inference as to guilt from his silence  i have made him fully aware of this  but this means the wallet can t count as evidence  no i m afraid not looks like mrs mills whole case is about to go down  mr husaini  can you tell us where the mercedes s class registration 321 d 520  was on the night of january 28th this year  yeah it was in the garage at the back of the embassy in london  it was being serviced we dropped the back axle out   you re certain it was this car  oh yes it was on my work log  it was booked in on 27th the work was completed three days later  thank you we d like to exhibit this log my lord  mr moncheri was alleged to have driven the car on the night of the 28th  did you tell the police about the log after they arrested him  yeah i told the superintendent bloke but he didn t seem that interested  he told the superintendent but he didn t seem that interested  thank you  mrs mills  when precisely did you tell the police mr husaini  was it before or after he was arrested or before or after he was charged  on the 31 st of january before they charged him  yes can you look at these exhibits 5b and 6b the detectives logs  each states that they went to the embassy in response to a call  to be told about the car on the 2nd of february   that s the day after the defendant was charged  yeah they made a mistake   oh i see they made a mistake you didn t  it s here on the garage log  yes  it s there somewhat differently on the logs of the policemen  and has been ever since our evidence was served  i think we ll let the jury decide when your log was written  perhaps mrs mills will also have made her closing speech by then   jo maev peters has turned up  when  she walked into the police station this afternoon she wants to give evidence  if the judge will let her i ll warn his clerk  i accept that miss peters was an important witness   the fact is you ve closed your case  she was prevented from giving evidence   i don t accept that mrs mills  i m not sure that i do either  she was warned off and fled there was no job in the gulf  two arabs approached her and threatened her   is there evidence of this intimidation  the police are investigating her story  i can t accept that these persons are in any way connected with the defendant  i hardly think it was the zionist league  you insist on assuming a degree of influence my client couldn t possibly possess  it s the effect of all that oil  do you object to this witness being brought in at this point   no  no  i thought i was going to hear a vigorous argument  we all want the same thing a just outcome  the prosecution can interpose this one witness then we ll continue with the defence  i want no hint of the alleged threats  you had sufficient time to look into the witness background  or do you need an adjournment   twenty four hours would be useful my lord  all right until tomorrow morning then  i m surprised at defence counsel allowing this witness to come back  he may know something we don t judge  one of the ushers overheard the junior and their instructing solicitor  talking in the tea bar  they have some sharp move planned with her  she might have been turned  so many routes of interference have been tried it s a real risk  i can t help you john  are you satisfied the circumstances of the witness sudden reappearance are genuine  if you think not go for a retrial   everyone seems keen for me to go there  just be careful john  there s a lot of pressure on everyone to stop this trial  my pps thought there s a risk this woman might name names in the witness box  it s a calculated risk neil  is no one going to get control of this trial  that in itself is fraught with danger  i didn t get where i am today by being afraid of danger ian  but the names that could come out scare even me  miss peters can you tell us where you were around 12 oo pm  on the night of the 28th of january   i was just leaving browns hotel in brighton  how did you know it was that time  because the man i was with had missed the last train to london   and was looking for a cab  did you encounter anyone else at that time  just as we were looking for a cab a car pulled in a black merc with a diplomatic plate   did you know this car  it was familiar  i m sometimes employed to entertain visiting diplomats   who organises this miss peters  there s an agency in brighton  oh  did you know anyone in the car  well the defendant got out and opened the back door for tracey   tracey spink did you know her  yes we d been on jobs  did anyone get out of the car apart from tracey and the defendant  no the passenger in the back didn t move  did you recognise this man  no   are you sure you didn t recognise this man  yes  did you not tell the police that you escorted this man out on a date  well i thought i had but i was mistaken  let us be quite certain about this   did you recognise the man in the back  no  i mean i thought his face was familiar but i m always doing that  seeing people and thinking that i know them  not even when you ve slept with them  no i didn t know him  miss peters is anyone threatening you in this matter   my lord i must protest  yes mr cantwell  i m allowing my desire for the truth to outrun the rules of procedure  do you wish to treat this witness as hostile mrs mills  my lord   mr cantwell  how can i properly resist my lord  go on  miss peters you are a prostitute are you not   i m a model  an escort model  who sells her services to men by the hour  when were you first hired out to sheik ali mazrui   my lord i must object  on what basis mr cantwell   the sheik isn t on trial  yes i know his driver is  be careful  miss peters how can you be sure  that the man in the back of the mercedes with tracey spink  was not sheik ali mazrui brother in law to the crown prince of the gulf state  i just am   did you get a clear look at him  yes i think so  you are certain that it was his driver who opened the back door for her  yes   did he leave the passenger in the back  yes he closed the door   what happened next  they went into the hotel together  and that s the last i saw of tracey  until you saw her photo in the newspaper following her murder  yes  is browns hotel somewhere that is frequented by escort models and their clients  they don t ask too many questions  nor judging by the absence of witnesses do they see or hear very much  miss peters  i would like you to think very carefully about when you first saw the defendant  outside browns at midnight on the 28th of january  and when subsequently did you see him  i saw his picture in the paper with his boss sheik mazrui after he was arrested  you clearly made a mistake in respect of sheik mazrui  you didn t in fact see him did you   no  no  miss peters you made another mistake in respect of mr moncheri  is that so   no it was him who got out of the car  do you like to read hello magazine miss peters  yes sometimes   you like to notice celebrities  it s nice when you see them on the street  see sheik ali is a celebrity hello did a story on him last year  when he came to negotiate a plane deal with britain  did you see this issue   yes  yes   do you remember seeing the sheik in it  i may have done  yes his driver is in the photo with him did you see that   possibly  they all look alike don t they celebrities  you saw a diplomatic car drop your friend  you identified the driver  after a picture of him and the sheik appeared in the press  after having seen them in hello  and you assumed it was him that you saw on the night of the 28th   is that not so  no   it was a dark night agreed  well yes   there was no moon you accept that  i don t remember it was dark  the street lights were very shadowy weren t they  yes  in fact the streetlight nearest the front of browns hotel was broken   i don t remember  don t you well i can assure you it was  i have here the council s report on the light  isn t it entirely possible that you didn t recognise the man with miss spink  any more than you did the man in the car   i think it was him  you re not sure  miss peters if i told you there is irrefutable evidence  that the defendant along with the sheik was elsewhere on the night in question  how sure would you be then  well the police told me it was him   oh my lord  miss peters  miss peters you must stop this right now  you cannot speak about anything unless you ve witnessed it   i did i was there when the police said it  miss peters  miss peters i cannot believe that you do not know what you re saying  my lord can i address the court on an urgent matter in the absence of the jury  yes i think i can guess what s coming  the defence has been utterly compromised by the prosecution s late witness   took you by surprise mr cantwell did she  she did   the case must be abandoned  no i m not inclined to do so  my lord a judge  has no discretionary powers to admit inadmissible evidence  if i might guide you to sparke versus the crown 1964  the basic principle is best summed up by mr justice roskill  in the crown against list 1966   a trial judge has an overriding duty to secure a fair trial   if this cannot be achieved a new trial must be ordered  yes  conversely a judge can allow things to continue if a gaffe does not make it impossible  for the crucial facts of the case to be thereafter considered by the jury  try the queen against weaver 1968 queens bench  trials have been allowed to continue where the perceived effect upon the jury is minimal   might we continue this in chambers  does your client consent to your seeing me  all rise  a retrial is the only way my client can get a fair hearing  it s certainly something i have to consider  there s no other possible course for a just outcome  if i did order a retrial  what would be the chances of the prosecution getting their main witness back up to speed   pretty negligible  hmm  well brian if i do as you ask i would feel compelled to ask the police   to investigate what i only suspect  investigate what  why bizarrely miss peters came out with all she did  this is an unsupportable assertion there is no shred of evidence  your junior and instructing solicitor were overheard  discussing this trial wrecking strategy brian  so i think the only common sense course would be for me to instruct the jury  to totally disregard the witness last two comments  and proceed with the trial don t you  hmm good  oh mrs brooks  it s here if we need it  you re free to go   is the prosecution s case now finally closed  it is my lord  mr cantwell will you resume the defence  with your leave my lord i have only one more witness  that is the gulf state s charge d affaires in marseilles  because i didn t expect to get done with the last witness so quickly  he wasn t asked to be here till tomorrow   well i look forward to the morning  all rise  you ve done it before  well because she s my wife   what am i supposed to do  you could just tell her you ve told her before   look it s not gonna  why does it always have to be what you want   i have a lecture to give  that s always your excuse  dad hi this is a surprise   this is henry kuhle he s my tutor  hello henry  hello and goodbye i ll catch you later charlie  oops sorry  he probably thinks i got you here to beat him up anyway   do you think i could you re spider man aren t you   do you want to have dinner  oh dad you should have called   i m having dinner with mum and neil  oh  is she really gonna marry him   he s made a pile of money in advertising  oh well that makes him perfect for her  do you still love her dad   i mean do you have any feelings for her  yeah sure mostly negative  i love her for you chaz i ll always love her for that  the problem is you can t just have the things that you love about your partner  other baggage comes along with it  listen can i give you a lift something i want to ask you   dad neil s sending his driver for me  oh okay  okay  oh gosh john is there something wrong   no i wanted to see you  i saw you in court  i miss you jo  when you re not my friend i miss you  i have to radically rethink my life   it looks pretty good to me  oh that is such a male viewpoint  you take things too personally  oh and who taught me to get close and personal  i feel like a child that can t break from its parent i ll never get out from under your influence  it s like i m always somehow your pupil  well i can t resolve that for you  you chose a profession where every move is circumscribed by the system  can look pretty grim sometimes  it looked pretty grim to me when i was a junior schlepping out to southend or chelmsford  to defend some kid already caught up in the criminal injustice system  i remember one day giving all the money i had on me  to some kid and telling him to run for it  i thought he d got more chance out there than caught up in the system  that was a real low point i felt like quitting that day  why didn t you  well you tell yourself you re gonna make a difference  instead i end up sending people like addem armitage to prison  hoping to keep other people from going there or so i told myself  we don t need critics jo we need examples  there are so few examples of selflessness or spiritual behaviour  it gets to us all finally  it s not just the system john   can you hear it all right mark  not down here   hello judge  how you doing mark  i m all right thanks   i d better go my policeman s waiting  so is mine   do you want some coffee  mmm  charlie stood me up for george and her new friend  they ll have a lot to talk about charlie and the secretary of state  nothing he ll want to hear though why does he allow the export of live animals  the import of animals for vivisection do business with korea and china  she could change the face of exploitation over dinner  marry me jo  could i bear to forego the pleasure of being able to appear before you  well you might have to  the lord chancellor sounded me out for the appeal court   wow are there strings  always strings   this case is becoming an issue  will you get the appointment before it s finished  you d better take it  deed  judge i ve just had a call from a friend in the logger s office  mary brookes the stenographer has reported your taking the record of the conversation  well thanks coop  problems  irrefutable  miss peters you must stop  well the police told me it was him  mr justice deed should not have allowed the trial to continue   after such a prejudicial remark  but he did  it seems that he is a law unto himself laurence  what this provides minister is a line for the appeal court to set aside any convictions  that won t help our case with the gulf state  you assured my pps the trial would collapse once maev peters had been on  instead deed threatens to expose us  this is like the worst of the bad old days  then it was the unions holding the country to ransom   how do you stop this man  he s a high court judge minister  for crying out loud we re the executive we appoint these people  why do you recommend such unreliable people to such unassailable positions   it s called separation of powers  of course we understand that  we need to subvert deed for the greater good ian   that s in train  darling we must go   i m being driven mad by your ex  tell me about it  in the car or we ll lose our reservation  nonsense they ll keep the restaurant open for me all night   you can t go like that charlie  why what s wrong with it   she s fine  well it s the restaurant darling  find her one of your exquisite dresses hmm  thank you  as charge d affaires is one of your duties to entertain and facilitate  gulf state businessmen in france  naturally this is one of my functions  on the evening of january the 28th of this year were you entertaining anyone from your country  yes sheik ali mazrui he was in marseilles  how can you be sure it was this time  we have a large social calendar we cannot make errors  the french minister of commerce was at dinner and also the head of french aerospace  was the defendant at dinner with you  a driver but of course not   did you see him in marseilles at that time  yes he drove the sheik to dinner  mr cantwell this appears to be an alibi why was notice of alibi not served  i must apologise my lord there was a valid reason  yes well i hope there was a valid reason   we ll grant leave on this occasion  my lord  i know mrs mills no doubt you will clarify the position for us  during your cross examination  mr shahatra why was the defendant s alibi not disclosed earlier  i cannot reveal that  do you hold the secrecy of a possible plane deal over a man s liberty  of course not we would not  isn t the real reason that this alibi was launched so late   because it was thought up late  i cannot answer that  well then i ll ask you a question that you can answer   at what point were you asked to give evidence  two months ago  that s two months after the defendant was charged  now if as you claim you entertained sheik ali mazrui in marseilles on the 28th of january  and you remember seeing the defendant there too  then he couldn t have murdered tracey spink   exactly so  unless you fabricated this whole story  i did not  i think we ll let the jury decide when they wonder why no member of your staff  initially came forward to provide a cast iron alibi and spare all this court time and money   i trust a british jury  i m sure you do thank you   do you wish to re examine mr cantwell no my lord  mr james  before you depart might we have a moment in chambers  you re free to go mr shahatra  mrs channing phoned to inquire if you were going to be at the lodgings this evening  so she can decorate my carpet again ah mr james  i understand you ve been taking the daily recording of court proceedings   the department thought it prudent my lord  did it to what end   that is for the lord chancellor my lord  do you think he even knows  senior lawyers in the department are concerned whether some evidence being admitted  might leave the verdict wide open to appeal  the jury might find him not guilty  what surprises me is that the secretary of state hasn t offered an alibi himself  will that be all my lord  mrs channing my lord   are you trying to sabotage my marriage plans  thank you mr johnson   will you be dining in my lord  yes i think so mr johnson   pre wedding nerves george hardly  neil is very cross with you over the way you re handling this case  how would he like me to handle it did he give you written instructions  don t be churlish  well my actions hardly reflect on you george you had the good sense to leave me after all  is there any way you could be more flexible about this case  flexibility that wraps itself about lover boy s convenience  is hardly compatible with justice for the murdered girl or her family  is this entirely about your feelings of jealousy   no it s entirely about justice  there s no such thing other than in the abstract  it is hard to find these days  but when you do get to it  when you get goosebumps or tingling along the spine  then you know you ve touched something decent and worthwhile  if you haven t felt it george why do you go on practising law   for money why else john  george  the desire for justice is one of the very finest of human aspirations at its most effective  the law is the bulwark of society  all those workers who had their lungs shredded by asbestos  all they need is one lawyer sufficiently touched by their predicament  i should have recorded this for poor neil  he imagined he could wreck the case by having that missing witness reappear  what  well you are still my daughter s father john  i think he knew that dead prostitute too but not personally  his department has to entertain these businessmen  all they ever want to do it seems is dive into the fleshpots   don t you dare tell him i told you  george you re a wonder  if there is any doubt any reasonable doubt that it was ali abdul moncheri  who killed tracey spink in brighton on the night of january the 28th  then you must find him not guilty  now if you conclude that the defendant did kill miss spink  but that he didn t mean to or to cause her serious bodily harm  then the lesser alternative of manslaughter is open to you   does anyone know what the form is  we re here to pick a foreman so the usher said  what about a forewoman why always a man  well why don t we just let the men decide dear  kathleen you can t be serious  oh i find it all hard to follow  why don t you be forewoman marlene you were taking most notes  yeah i agree with that  definitely  okay okay well then let s take a little vote to see where we all stand on guilty and not guilty  ah um there s a third alternative undecided   yes  yes all right all those for guilty   yeah guilty  two seven  and not guilty   yeah yeah  one  two  that just leaves undecided   undecided i m afraid  undecided  the thing that worries me is this embassy official from france  why would he lie about the sheik and his driver being there  he didn t seem the type  well gerry hewitt saw that driver dumping the girl s body with his own eyes  that s presumably how mr shahatra saw the defendant in marseilles kathleen  doesn t poor mr hewitt see all sorts of people when they don t exist  what about the dead girl s skin particles in the boot of the diplomatic car  and moncheri s hair found on her i mean that s important evidence yeah  the dead girl may have been in the boot  does it mean that he killed her or that he put her there  that s right we re trying him not anyone else  the guy in the dock did have his hair on her  james you know what sort of work she did who s to say he hadn t been with her days earlier   hair s a devil to get off your clothes it could have been a mix  up in the lab   well not according to that forensic woman  she would say that  and why didn t moncheri say anything in the court  maybe he was scared i know i would be if i came up before a court in the gulf state  why s that  because you wouldn t get a fair trial they d stone you  let s take another vote all those for guilty okay five  this is my youngest grandchild   oh she s lovely  the poor dear has got a cleft palate  she s been waiting over a year to get it done she doesn t complain  i ll say a prayer for her to get it fixed soon  kathleen hi  in church last night i had an answer about your granddaughter  my cousin he s a nasal maxillo surgeon   he could see her in harley street  oh we couldn t afford to go private  no no no well ralph he makes enough money from those who can afford to pay  no he does some operations for free  and not guilty  one two three four five six  this is stupid how can you change like that  james everyone has a perfect right to change his or her mind   you mustn t try to badger people  they should do what s right   what according to you  you all thought he was guilty   you ve all been got at  persuaded through argument  i don t believe this he offered me a job  i m sorry i ll take it back i m sorry  look i ve seen what he s been doing during the coffee breaks   how many others has he offered something to  hold on a minute i m just being friendly  we re all in this together anyway i was one of the undecideds  yes he only changed his mind on the fourth vote   thank you  i m not stupid   he s got at everyone here  you re acting up because you didn t win  look it s just your opinion james whatever we decide it s the majority decision  members of the jury have you reached a verdict upon which at least 10 of you have agreed  yes we have  on the count of murder do you find the defendant ali abdul moncheri  guilty or not guilty  not guilty  on the alternative to that of murder namely manslaughter  do you find the defendant guilty or not guilty  not guilty   we weren t all agreed it wasn t unanimous  i don t want to know   i voted guilty  please sit down  may my client now be discharged my lord  the jury were got at   yes you were he got at every one of us  dock officer i haven t ordered his release yet  the court has no legal right to hold him after the jury has acquitted him  as your lordship knows  members of the jury i want you to go with the jury bailiff and wait in your room  mr frey you will be taken to a room by yourself for the moment   my lord i must insist  he remains in custody for now  then i shall seek a writ of habeas corpus  well then you d better get going you need to get to the high court by 4 30   traffic s appalling this time of day  all rise  not guilty not guilty   has he gone completely mad  oh i do hope so brian mrs cooper  sir ian rochester judge   john i m shocked by what you ve just done  i m rather surprised myself  any inquiry into the possible misconduct by the jury can have no bearing now  the defendant was found not guilty   but it does bear investigation ian  my lord you now hold this man illegally  no i ve simply yet to release him   this is an affront to justice  i m glad to see you ve become its champion   it s my only concern in this matter  ah  i thought the 10 billion plane order might have been a factor  or the department of trade pimping for the arabs  john you must release him or risk bringing ridicule to our criminal justice system  you overstate the case surely  one is trying to deliver a just outcome by the most expedient means  you can t believe there won t be consequences mr james  my lord what you have done is a clear and substantial abuse  of the 1998 human rights act and of moncheri s right to be treated as not guilty  also an inviolable rule under english law  unlike some english law the european act is in statute  and not subject to change at the judge s whim   you think my actions whimsical do you  they are fast becoming farcical my lord   what signal does this send to the arabs  the clear signal that our system is not corrupt  that it cannot be perverted by lost witnesses slipping in at the last moment  to make prejudicial trial wrecking statements with the full knowledge  of senior civil servants and ministers of state  now was there anything else  yes  unless you release this man right now  your elevation to the appellate bench will not happen  get out   perhaps someone will assassinate him sir ian  one can only pray   i d better warn neil  sir  mrs cooper  get superintendent craddock for me right away would you please coop  i want him to interview maev peters tell him it s very urgent  if our deal with the gulf state is totally lost i ll murder him george  you lost darling accept it  george i can t remember the last time i lost anything  i m gonna pull this baker s boy off his self erected pedestal  a lot want to do that get in line  watch this space darling  ali find tony jones have him meet me at my office at 6 15  hi it s george  look can we make it another evening something s come up with neil  you have something you want to say to me  yeah well i have been on jobs with them  they like to play sex games  moncheri put a noose around my neck like the one that killed tracey  well that s a start  i d barricade the doors if i were you   you think the arabs will come after me  i think they re the least of your problems  i could have neil haughton and ian rochester summoned for criminal contempt  it was them that nobbled the jury   no  yeah  moncheri was rearrested the moment he was released  all they could get him for was disposing of the body  but he ll get eight years for that and it gets better  one of the jurors was a member of the security services  his connections to the government become clearer by the moment   you better not go to sleep tonight  sleep wasn t what i had in mind actually jo   mrs channing is here my lord  oh isn t this cosy  why jo i do believe you re blushing  yeah well george in spite of life some of us have retained that facility  to what do we owe this unannounced interruption george  the housekeeper s only just got the curry sauce out of the carpet  i obviously made a mistake  i did want to say how much i enjoyed the other evening here  it was always your best role   this is clearly unfinished business  don t fall for it jo  forget it  shall i serve your takeaway now my lord  yes  yeah you ve been watching too much what is it   formula 1  formula 1  i ll beat you any day gran   you know you should be pushing me  oh there we go  okay  you won t go and leave me like your poor mum  mum s dead nan she is  i sometimes wonder if you know more than you let on  in that world of yours  police are mounting a reconstruction of geri landers last known movements  hoping it would jog someone s memory  geri was savagely beaten to death on the way home from work  anyone with any information should contact the incident room on o1273  gary food s on the table  you re supposed to clear up  i don t know why i keep putting food on the table for you  or her in there  i don t want none  starve then see if i care  so if you d just sign there and there   keeping out of trouble gary  i did it   it was me i did  what did you did gary  i killed i killed geri i followed her to bluebell wood  is this just another story gary  i did it  i hit her with an iron bar then i thrown it in the park  i did it i did it it s my fault i did do it   anything interesting mr harrison  a fraud case my lord  you may have read about it the eco mortgage scandal   oh can t we dump it on somebody else  i thought you d welcome it my lord  two lawyers accused of falsifying mortgage records  they hold 900 mortgages worth some 120 million  they fall behind on their payment  hope we get a good jury coop  john the clerk of number two told the list officer you had precedence in a case i m hearing  the eco mortgage fraud  i ve done a lot of the background work it s one of those victimless crimes   didn t know there was such a thing  i m not even sure there s a prima facie case  well either way you re the answer to my prayer robert  would you like to send your clerk around for the papers  no  i need to get back in shape far too easy for you  i saw jo mills at the bailey the other day   she never mentioned it  oh we had lunch  is it all over with you  do you have a case there  oh i m keeping an eye on something   you didn t answer my question  what you planning to take her out  no not if it causes us problems  if she went out with you row she d realise just what good value i am   you re hearing the eco mortgage fraud  not any more  judge home nearly ran me down to get it   was it in your list  not according to robert home  any possibility he s behaving fraudulently  i very much doubt it  is that what you know or want to believe  well doesn t the old school tie system tend to discourage corrupt judges in this country  two were investigated last year   the attorney issued a nolle  there was no case to answer  they re members of the same club as the attorney  you re getting cynical row  the police suspect a network of corrupt lawyers all masons  there has to be a judge or two among them  is that what you know or want to believe  it s the only way it could work consistently  is this an on going investigation  not going anywhere they can t nail a judge  or daren t   you ve never refused me before  i m older and wiser  well older anyway  you should let it go it s past  you don t have to go with me jo  old habits are hard to break  there are new means of testing forensic evidence  i m determined to get this before the criminal cases review commission  it ll be another 12 years what could be new  jimmy darvall telling us who really did it   i ve become a buddhist mr deed  you can still proclaim your innocence jimmy  being in prison isn t important it s karma  but if you tell us who really did it you ll give him the chance to pay off his karma  that s possible jo  then you agree that there was a third party in the room   i can still see that axe in my hand  an axe without your fingerprints on it  i must accept what your father in law said in his summing up  mr justice channing said that i wiped the handle clean  no cloth with blood on it was ever found  some things are inexplicable mr deed   are they treating you all right  oh yes  the food s wonderful  i m gonna keep looking  jimmy darvall didn t kill his wife  i m as convinced now as i was 12 years ago when i defended him  your capacity for emotional involvement never ceases to amaze me  the law isn t a trade in inanimate objects joe it s about people human judgements  if there is even the faintest whiff of injustice we should be entitled to investigate   the police found no evidence for a third party  they didn t look beyond jimmy darvall  well presumably they didn t think it necessary  that s one of the weaknesses of the judicial system   the police work for the prosecution virtually  so we have to rely on the police in these matters   and have even more miscarriages of justice  hysterical nonsense  joe you were the trial judge  only you can sanction my seeing the prosecution evidence  i am not inclined to help the verdict was correct  then i ll find another way  so long as you don t use your own judicial powers to look  that would be entirely improper  and keep you off the appellate bench forever  before i hear your opening mr brill i d like to see counsel in chambers  you could get yourselves some coffee  all rise  is this case ready to go to a jury clive   the cps believes it  on this evidence  a confession from a suspect with a mental age of 13  a solicitor was present and an appropriate adult  he did then subsequently withdraw his confession  there is strong forensic evidence  he had the dead girl s bloodstained scarf her blood was on his clothes  his glasses and an earring belonging to him were found at the scene  and what do you have to say  without the confession he made in the first place we wouldn t be here  presumably the cps has some basis for their optimism let me hear it  at the time of making his confession how did gary patterson behave  i d say he was distraught  you said you knew the young man  yes sir he d come into the station from time to time for a chat   had you seen him in this state before  no sir  thank you sergeant  remind me when you made your note  it was shortly after i called the murder squad  how long after he made his confession  fifteen minutes my lord it s a contemporaneous note sir  well not quite  but i do understand the difficulty of getting such notes down  why wasn t he cautioned immediately after he made his confession sergeant   we were a little taken aback miss  because you didn t believe him   no he had all the right facts  facts anyone could have gathered surely   i don t know miss  lf you think about it sergeant  you ll find that all the information that gary patterson had was in the public domain  my lord is my learned friend making her closing speech   are you mrs mills  i have no further questions  thank you sergeant you can step down  was there something else  no sir  with your leave my lord my next witness detective superintendent craddock  is likely to be on for a good while  in view of the hour might it not be sensible to call him first thing tomorrow  we should at least get started  superintendent after you charged gary patterson with murder  could you tell the court what you found in his room at his father s house  lots of newspaper photos of the dead girl pinned to his wall   did you draw any conclusion from that  he appeared to be obsessed with the victim  did you find anything else in his room that was relevant to the investigation  a number of items belonging to geri  a cheap bracelet a mitten two sprite cans with her lipstick on  and a scarf her mother identified geri was wearing on the day of her death  it was bloodstained   did you identify this blood  yes it was geri landers  did the defendant say how he came by these items  including the bloodstained scarf  he said he found them   did you believe him  i didn t disbelieve him  i asked him if he saw her drop them he said he did   so you didn t believe him to be a liar  i believed his confession  did you believe him when he said he found the bloodstained scarf  no  so you chose only to believe the things that suited your case  no that logic told me were true  is it possible that he could ve stumbled across the body  it s possible  there had been no attempt to conceal it  she lay where she fell the surrounding undergrowth was flattened  did you ascertain how  could the young woman have met a lover there  the undergrowth was minutely searched for clues  there was nothing apart from a gold earring and a pair of spectacles   and who found these items  the scenes of crime officers sir  are you calling them mr brill  um  not unless your lordship wants to question them  the defence accepts the witness statements  did you establish whose glasses they were  the glasses and earring belonged to the defendant  might it be sensible if i cross examined the witness  yes  how do you know that these glasses belonged to the defendant  he identified them as his  and you knew that he sometimes told the truth when it suited your case   were they found under the body  no on the undergrowth   was there blood on the undergrowth  yes there was a lot of blood spray  generally or directional  mostly between nine and twelve on the clock face   was there blood on the glasses  yes about eight or nine flecks   did mr patterson have blood on his clothes  he did  clothes you identified that he was wearing at the time  yes  how much blood was on him  two spots on his jeans and several more on the welts of his trainers   but not on the tops of his trainers  none were found there  superintendent if none were found it means none were there  yes my lord  what violence do you judge was used to inflict these fatal injuries  like someone gone berserk   causing a wide spray pattern of blood  yes   that didn t spray his clothes  how is that  i can t say  in view of the hour mrs mills i think this might be a convenient moment  all rise  my great nephew s rowing at henley i hope we ll get time out robert  i m sure we can arrange that james  morning  is that the judge who s having an affair with his clerk  who s that with judge home  the defence barrister in the eco mortgage fraud sir james valentine   no the other one  oh that s marcus hargreaves solicitor  could you get me a favour from one of your friends  i need details of some old fraud cases  i don t want anybody to know about it  i m sure i can find someone judge  if i m wrong about this coop  it could do a lot of damage  am i ever going to get to meet this man  i think henry s a bit nervous of you  can he reasonably go on teaching you if you re having a relationship  he s not likely to give me good marks just cause we re going out  do you have a bright friend who could do some legal research for me   depends how much it pays  he d need to be computer literate  dad there are no computer illiterate students  more than anything they d need to be discreet  that might be a stretch everyone wants to talk to the media  so why are you being so secretive  ajudge might be behaving corruptly  cool  it hardly describes how i ll be treated if i ve got this wrong chaz   so why bother then  why bother about anything  why bother about what s happening to animals  because they re victims i thought this was victimless  nobody s being mugged but falsifying mortgage records is a crime  the what can i get away with attitude that our society tolerates degrades us all  look you mustn t let this get to you  am i  you barely noticed the two pretty waitresses  i probably thought they were too young  carol s quite old she s nearly 40  nearly 40 are you kidding that s far too old  what would i have to do on these cases  try to find a common thread  this could cause a huge scandal  takes a lot to scandalise us nowadays chaz  hey how s it going   are you carol mmm hmm  charlie was right ow   we ll have a bottle of the house red please  sure   this is my dad carol  oh your dad i thought it was your date  well i suppose i could stretch a point  she seeing anybody   aren t you seeing jo any more  i see her in court  superintendent craddock let s consider the forensic evidence  the murder weapon were gary s fingerprints on the murder weapon  no but he showed us exactly where he d thrown it in the pond  did you consider that this slightly obsessed young man  might have followed the victim  and witnessed her murder and seen where the real murderer threw the murder weapon  i m in the business of collecting evidence if that had been the case  he would have made a witness statement not a confession  but if he were feeling guilty about following her  that s a question for a psychiatrist mrs mills are you calling one   i m not  no  didn t think i recalled seeing a report in the bundles  let us return to the blood on gary s clothing  this was found to have the same dna profile as geri s  yes  have you seen the results of the independent dna tests  the defence had done on the two spots of blood on his jeans  yes   do you recall the results  they didn t match ours did  are you submitting this report mrs mills  it s item 2d in your bundle my lord  when gary was making his confession  did he say what he d been doing since the murder  no he d been at home he doesn t work   did he mention his bedridden nan  no but i believe he looked after her  he d looked after her since the death of his mother when he was 12  hardly the profile of a stone cold killer superintendent  is that a question mrs mills  i have no further questions thank you superintendent  what are you doing   why you made me jump  what are you doing down here   research i m doing research  you shouldn t be here on your own   well where s denis the man who let me in  he s gone off duty  it s nearly 8 oo  oh i missed my bus  who gave you permission to be here  denis marlowe said i m doing work for my dad mr justice deed  oh  why didn t you say   are you taking those out miss  is that okay  write the folio and case number in the book  i blew your cover dad i didn t realise denis had gone  something like this is hard to keep quiet  maybe coop will cover our trail  dr vaughan would you please examine exhibit 1 a  and tell the jury what it is  an iron bar 70 centimetres long weighing 1 2 kilos and pitted with rust  it was used to murder geri lander   you are certain of that dr vaughan  yes  i examined it as part of the scene of crime evidence  i found blood and particles of hair clinging to the surface  both dna matched to geri  how does blood and hair remain on an iron bar submerged in water for eight days  in the absence of an emulsifier such as washing up liquid or agitation  minute amounts of oxygen encapsulate the blood and hair and keep them inert  it takes quite a lot to wash off blood   the blood was type o the most common type  yes  do you know what blood group gary patterson is  blood type o but the dna is specific to geri s and not gary patterson s blood  you visited the scene of the crime  several times to measure the blood spread on the undergrowth  the angle of projectile in blood  you concluded that the blows to the left side of her head  meant that the assailant was right handed   blood projected to the left and rear left would any have sprayed forward  there was blood in a forward position  much blood  yes the blows that shattered the skull bone cut the left anterior arterial to the brain  in your report marked k in your bundle my lord  you comment on the defendant s clothing  indeed we do have the trousers in question  the police identified the jeans the defendant was wearing on the night of the murder  you examined these trousers had they been washed  no i found blood matched to the victim s  remind the jury how much blood was found on the garment  one smear that matched the girl s blood and a trace that also matched hers   there was no other blood on the jeans  no my lord  dr vaughan could there be other spots of blood that you failed to test  no i tested all the blood there  how do you explain so little blood following such a savage attack  um my lord  i m not quite sure of procedure with your lordship cross examining the witness  but you are calling for speculation on the part of this witness  deduction mr brill deduction  all the difference in the world dr vaughan  a number of reasons  the girl may have put her hands up and prevented front forward spray  the photos don t show blood on the victim s hands  well perhaps it might be sensible to hold a view so the jury can see the scene of the crime  then we can all see exactly where the blood went  i thought your judge didn t want anything known about this rita   oh ben goldin found her down here  she was entitled to be here i said  can we do anything about these entries denis  not really  if i tear that page out it ll only draw attention to what it is you re trying to hide  the undergrowth was hardly grown at the time of the attack  what there was had been trampled  the red flags sir show the pattern at its most dense  it s a radius of about ten feet  yes most of the blood at four feet  can we assume that the attacker stood in front of the victim  yes sir just to her right  and the blood is thinnest right behind him  why wasn t there more blood on the clothing are we sure of the clothes he was wearing  her blood was on his jeans  well possibly mr patterson will explain the absence of blood to us if he gives evidence  i m sure he will   where were the glasses found  alongside the body  what did that tell the police  that the murderer dropped them in the struggle  are they gary patterson s glasses  yes he identified them as being his when he confessed my lord  he withdrew his confession but not his admission that they were his glasses  did he volunteer that he d lost his glasses  or did you tell him that you d found his glasses next to the body  i don t remember my lord  perhaps we should jog your memory  we found some spectacles by geri s body do you recognise them  the suspect nodded is that yes gary  yes yeah i lost them that night  had mr patterson mentioned losing his glasses before this interview  you can answer from there  i i don t recall my lord  we only seem to have his word that they re his glasses  has the defence checked mr patterson s prescription against these glasses   we re still trying to do that  why is it taking so long   i m conducting the defence my lord  hmm  i dare say we re all grateful that murder now only carries a life sentence  i agree with your lordship in the light of your taking over  the conduct of the prosecution and defence in a murder trial  until the morning  all rise  there s a pattern even in the first four cases   did you stay up all night  it s exciting once you find a way in  connection one all the defendants were acquitted  two all were so called victimless crimes  three judges were involved including robert home they all went to oxford   so did two thirds of all judges including me  all were members of brown s  your starter for 10 what s the other connection  wearing aprons and rolling up their trouser legs   haven t had time to check if they re masons yet  row colemore can do that  the instructing solicitors on the fraud case in front of judge home westwake hargreaves  were the instructing solicitors on most of the other fraud cases   westwake hargreaves you sure  i think so look i found this   that s judge home  where did you get this  from the clerk at judge home s old chambers   that s peter hargreaves  yes i know  it s an eerie coincidence  peter hargreaves was the instructing solicitor when i defended jimmy darvall   was that a fraud case  no murder  these solicitors are connected to most of the fraud cases  was that stupid or what  that s what i was thinking at 3 oo in the morning  with too much caffeine swilling around in my brain  i started to get paranoid thinking   i m being set up someone wants me to find this  then i think no get some sleep and just review it in the morning  conclusion  they re not stupid dad they re just overconfident  porcini boccone is great  that s a lot of food you could share it with your guest  oh he s not that type   what do you do when you get off work  i go home to bed  that is a novel idea   charlie said you re a high court judge  we go to bed too  don t believe a word he says  carol is trying to persuade me to share the porcini boccone with you  do we have that sort of relationship  oh let s just have a bottle of the organic house red please  okay  great legs john  great mind too  she s a mature student reading philosophy at sussex  why spoil it  you had dinner with jo mills  yes  go anywhere interesting  no her place   you don t mind  no said i didn t  there s not a bit of meat on the entire menu  at least it guarantees we won t see any judges or lawyers  i think we might have found something on this fraud case  well at least charlie has  you re a mason aren t you row  was that the connection pretty weak cement  it s not what holds them together   well money s a powerful magnet  maybe  coupled with a wonky rationale like victimless crime  here we are   i think we re ready to order carol  i put myself entirely in your hands carol  talk to me denis   what happened  what do you think   they re moving me  because you helped the judge  i m being moved to aylesbury   well did you talk to the union  nothing they can do it s a transfer   he s convinced it s as a result of helping us  yeah  perhaps i should speak to the resider  i don t think it ll do any good judge   ah john  good afternoon michael ian  one of our circuit judges has complained about you  interfering with the course of a case he s hearing  really  and how does he know what it is that i m supposed to have done  i m not sure we should even discuss it without him  better here and now than when it s too late  action outside of a court can be entirely misconstrued  you must be careful john  what is it that he thinks that i m supposed to have done  it seems you ve been examining his cases  here and where he sat previously as a recorder in order to affect his current case  well that s a pretty serious indictment  have you been doing as he suggests  if you have any suspicions you should bring them to the lord chancellor  these cases are a matter of public record  judges tend to trust one another john  there are rumours of a judge being involved with the solicitors on trial here  in the eco mortgage fraud  perhaps you should wait and see what comes out in evidence  it s a closed world michael  supported by the old boy network clubs and masonic lodges  as far as i know mason s only do charitable work  ah  you ll do both the bench and the department more harm than good by fuelling these rumours  you ll have every judge in the country against you   do you want such a response from your brothers  so what s new  if you ever find anything that troubles you come to us john there s a good fellow  we are the proper authority to examine such matters  this is charlie deed please leave a message  charlie it s me i hope you re safely tucked up in a lecture  this is getting complicated the forces of reaction want us to stop  call me   any luck  got a couple of items  is there a programme where i can run a search on names alone  there is it ll cost you   how about a cappuccino  make it a skinny latte and you ve got a deal  you have to specify the name  if you just say green you ll get everyone called green with share interests   well i can be fairly detailed  okay let s get this search horse up and running  what name do you want a search on  robert alexander randolph home  at least he isn t john smith  he owns 80 ooo shares in amax conversions plc  go into amax see how his shares are allotted  it doesn t work  it s a blind trust for people like politicians  who need to be seen to be given up their vested interests  see if any other names on my list are holders in amax  try sir james valentine  all the names you gave me bar one are masons   who s the exception  marcus hargreaves  he s one of the partners of westwake hargreaves  he took his brother s place when he died last year  john the mason s aren t proscribed  i m simply looking for a thread  well there s no indication on criminal intent  no charlie s working on it  stop him somebody stop him  mr collins how often did gary patterson come into your chemist shop  quite often to get his nan s prescriptions  did geri serve him on those occasions  if she was on the pharmacy side i was encouraging her to learn pharmacy  she was a very bright girl  she was planning to try for an open university degree  how did she react to the defendant  she was very nice to him she was so very nice to everyone  she just made work seem such a pleasure   did she treat him like any other customer  no differently  and how did he behave towards her  he hung around her a lot  did she encourage his attention  no not a bit never  was there ever an occasion when he forced himself upon her   my lord that s not a proper question  yes mr brill  did you ever see the defendant behave improperly towards geri  he made a grab for her a couple of times  uh he often followed her  i sometimes walked her through the park because of it  that was soon after she started going out with a new boyfriend  do we know who this boyfriend is  the police were unable to find him my lord  she and gary had a bit of an argument about that  he grabbed her arm she shrugged him away he ran off  would you say he was violent towards her  yes  but gary wasn t normally a violent boy not like some of them  did geri say what the row was about  my lord this is a line of questioning that requires third party reporting  yes was gary present at this conversation mr collins   no  i withdraw the question  i think this might be a convenient moment  all rise  i had everything dad  i spent hours going through those records just like henry told me to  someone stole them all it can t be coincidental can it  we should stop this right now   dad you can t be serious  you could have been hurt   they re all masons  the masons aren t proscribed chaz  something is going on there are too many coincidences  judge home owns 80 ooo shares in amax conversions plc  they hold six million shares in moraira plc  the company in the shipping fraud judge home tried last year  he acquitted the two directors   did you remember all that  there s lots i can t remember  seven of the people on that list hold shares in amax including sir james valentine  the solicitors for amax are westwake hargreaves  amax holds shares in companies other judges are trying for fraud of some sort   were they all acquitted  i don t know  do we have a case  oh we have enough to destroy the reputations of all concerned but not enough to convict them no   so how do we move forward this is so exciting  this is not a game chaz  once a reputation is destroyed you can t put it back by saying sorry   we can t just do nothing  lf it was the papers they were after  somebody is prepared to act criminally to get them   then i ll go back and get them again  no  not on your own you won t  there s something else  the two lawyers that judge home is trying are associates of westwake hargreaves  they get around  if you are going back i m sending stephen with you just to be certain  you saw carol the other night  yeah yeah she um she  she wrote her phone number on my bill  i m not into long term relationships   carol s a grown woman dad  yeah  was geri particularly nice to gary  she didn t encourage him  but she showed him affection beyond courtesy to a customer did she not  not that i noticed miss  she wasn t interested  she wasn t hostile to his displays of affection  she was too kind she d chat away to him  ask him about his gran  he never had much to say poor lad  but she said something to you  yes we were very close  she told me  she told me she thought he was pathetic   was that after he went out with her  she never  she wouldn t  you re privy to all her movements  well no but she wouldn t  did you ever see gary behave violently around geri  that time he grabbed her yeah  isn t the truth of the matter that gary was in love with the girl  and mostly followed her at a distance unable to approach her  like i said he was pathetic  oh i thought you said geri thought he was pathetic  not you   terminal six is free now miss  miss  it s charlie  i bribed you with the skinny latte remember   but someone nicked the papers i got  what papers are they  did somebody get to you   what are you talking about  has anyone approached you about miss deed  is that her name thought she was a nutter   somebody did get to you  terminal six  tell me what you re after  is the defence ready to proceed mrs mills  we are my lord with your leave i call gary patterson  what happened to mr patterson  he won t say it s believed he was beaten up at the remand centre  i see  hold the bible in your raised hand and read the words on the card  just repeat the words after the usher  no just a minute  gary  can you read gary  i can but with my glasses i can  has no one given you replacement glasses in the last five months  i did have some yeah  give him his glasses from the table  can you read the words  can you read gary  i could once  can someone verify whether the defendant can read  he can read sir   and you are  dale patterson gary s father  okay thank you mr patterson  can someone find him some reading glasses  put them on gary  and read from the card  i swear by god  almighty that the  evidence shall  be the truth  nothing but the whole truth  good now try the other glasses  can you see the words on the card   no  why is that  i don t i don t know  i think you do gary  i trust you are going to call mr patterson s optician mrs mills  oh i am my lord  before we proceed i will see counsel in chambers  all rise  the conduct of this case is shambolic it has scant regard for the truth  i thought the trial was about the presentation of fact  it should be about discovering the truth that s what the public expects of us  i don t believe that either you or the cps tested the evidence  the glasses found by the body are clearly not the defendants   is the earring his  he identified it as being his   you challenging that  of course there s no dna linking it to him  and you re content not to submit evidence from your psychiatrist  i am  presumably because it s unhelpful to your case  i m going to adjourn this trial  and have the defendant examined by a psychiatrist  hopefully i will have a report by monday i will disclose the contents to you both  i hope that one of you will call the psychiatrist  do you want a hand to analyse it all   is that your strong point  i was always pretty good at reasoning  then why didn t you become a lawyer  i couldn t afford the extra year should i stick around  why don t you just get to it you want to take me out  mind reading s another of your talents   i m seeing a lecturer  oh well i can t compete with that  he s married  look if i went out with a policeman  i wouldn t have any other friends they all do dope or social dissidence  then you d better give me their names  you d better not lose that  mrs cooper  can i grab a lift back  i ll be right with you i ll catch you up   what is it sergeant  look  the judge ought to know something in the prosecutions case  that wasn t disclosed to the defence  it may not mean very much coop in view of the evidence   even so it should have been disclosed judge  i ll make sure it is  oh tell mr harrison that dr eugene baldichino is the psychiatrist of choice  avoid those on the home office list  will all parties involved please proceed to court three  all parties  constable ashurst  is there a problem   should there be  you lot don t dig us out otherwise  what sort of problem might there be  well i did smoke in the judge s car   oh you think this a matter for mirth  no sir  there s been a complaint against you  you ve been misappropriating police resources to help mr justice deed further a private vendetta  i ve been helping collect information on possible fraud sir  oh and what fraud is that  i think i d better talk to the judge first sir  not before you talk to us  they can t keep the files who were they  policemen who investigate policemen  you didn t do anything wrong stephen   i m sorry i lost the files judge  hi this is charlie deed   please leave a message  did you get a receipt  chaz it s me  call me as soon as you can i think we ve got a problem  judge i m ready  you re miles away  i feel like walking   charlie have you got the file  yeah and i gave stephen a copy too  what s wrong  nothing s wrong i m with carol i ll talk to you tomorrow sweetheart bye bye   so have you two always been close  yeah  charlie spent most of her time with me after her mother and i divorced  lucky her  the fire detector off a fire engine   you re a bit off your beaten track aren t you  well this looks like your home from home   hi carol  hi  oh carol this is jo who s appearing before me   i ve heard a lot about you  have you  have you eaten   no  yeah  it s a bit of a busman s holiday for me  have the white bean and pumpkin chilli tacos it s very special  or we could all go and eat together somewhere else  i think the prosecution would object  gary i want you to think very carefully before answering this question  do you understand  did you kill geri lander  no no  why did you tell the police you had  they were kind to me so i  were you there when she was killed   is that a yes gary  yes  did you see who did it  well why didn t you tell the police that  i don t know  did you see this person hit geri with the iron bar  was it a man you saw  yes  have you seen this man before gary  gary you say you didn t kill geri is that right  gary is this man you say killed geri a friend of yours   gary is he someone known to you  no  we ll need some help  get a doctor  gary patterson had an epileptic seizure  is he gonna be all right  i doubt it the doctors aren t sure if he can undergo such intense examination again  it s beginning to feel like a replay of the jimmy darvall trial  i don t see it  this boy allegedly followed the girl rowed with her  and then killed her when she rejected him jimmy came home the worse for drink  killed his young wife when she said she was leaving him  yes we argued that there was a third party present  i think that jimmy knew that person and blocked him out  and possibly gary patterson did the same thing  pound gets us on the bus we ain t got 20 pence unless either one talks  john could we have a conversation  i d catch you at the digs but you lead such a social life   i ll be at the digs for tea  excellent mrs mills  sounds like a wrap on the knuckles   having such a social life  he s reading the wrong diary  are you serious about row colemore  does it matter  no if it s what you want  i liked your waitress friend carol she s very warm  hmm hmm   yes very bright too  and you get to eat healthily  this sort of thing erodes the credibility of the bench  little by little it diminishes our authority  no michael rumour of corruption that we fail to deal with does that  are you investigating robert home  it s not a vendetta  it s such a breach of etiquette john  i have a suspicion that i wish to investigate to my satisfaction  i would have hoped with your support  you ll have to seek that from the circuit resider i take a very dim view of it  i suspect he will too  yes  i feel cheated like you let me win  i ve never thrown a match in my life  well you didn t try very hard  oh i m sorry i m distracted  do you think jo could be using you to wind me up  ha you wish  you miss her john  i see her every day in court  at some point john we ve got to take action on this investigation  is there anything on this judge yet  have you got somebody reliable in the cps  no but i wouldn t let that deter me  i have to congratulate you sir john it s a first rate job of detection  well charlie did most of the donkey work  in attempts to convict such high profile figures  the cps needs to feel confident about any witnesses   we need someone to point the finger  we won t get that unless we give it to the police  then it ceases to be discreet  we ve given up our megaphones john   we would need at least one solid witness  and who do you suggest  the two solicitors currently on trial  won t they think they re better off in front of judge home  no not necessarily home knows we re onto him he d be obliged to play a straight bat  i could have a word with my colleagues  the solicitors might get a deal for turning against their cohorts  even at this late stage  worth a try  mrs mills can you tell us of the state of mr patterson s health  he s recovering from the seizure my lord he is not yet fit enough to resume evidence  is he likely to return to the witness box in the near future  the doctors are optimistic  is he able to give you instruction  i have received instructions i should like to call mr patterson s optician  amber hollick  this is an expert witness has the prosecution seen her report  i submitted it during the adjournment  mr brill  it does appear to be an ambush my lord  but i ve accepted there were valid reasons  did you prescribe eye glasses for gary patterson  yes about four years ago   we haven t seen him since  what condition does he have  a genetic malformation of the lens  well he can t see objects close to   is this a condition that rights itself  no not in my experience  were you asked to examine a pair of spectacles and compare them to mr patterson s prescription  exhibit 2c  these are the glasses i examined  are they glasses that you or any optician  would have prescribed for the defendant s condition  no they wouldn t have corrected it  let the jury be certain about this  could these glasses ever have been gary s   no  thank you miss hollick  mr brill would you like to examine this witness  thank you my lord no  mrs mills in the circumstances do you wish to call the psychiatrist dr baldichino  yes my lord with your leave  i believe you recently examined mr patterson  yes i examined him as thoroughly as i was able in prison  did you form an opinion on his mental state  there is no condition as such which marks gary as being  mentally unstable psychotic  his social function is limited by his emotional age  he s a 22 year old man with the emotional age of someone in his early teens  he s socially inadequate he can t interact with his peers  and is easily distressed and embarrassed especially with the opposite sex  tongue tied to a point of total frustration  is gary in your opinion a violent personality  no  he s quite benign  his constant attention to his bedridden grandmother is an example  in helping her he finds a role in life  did you ascertain the causes of his emotional retardedness  he witnessed his mother die violently when he was 12  how did she die  she fell down the stairs during a row with gary s father  gary has an exaggerated need for attention and approval  that his father wasn t able or willing to provide  could he get this say by giving comfort and succour   yes he could  and how would that make him feel  good worthwhile useful  he d be neither threatened nor challenged he d get the approval he craves  dr baldichino  in this situation if he were lying about killing the girl  would he be aware of it  it is likely that in such an emotional state he might believe he d done something  he d only witnessed  would such a person be able to sustain this fiction over a long period  say 10 or 12 years  when access to reality is cut off by some emotional block  such as false sense of guilt  it can be sustained indefinitely  thank you   socially inadequate immature unable to interact   gets distressed and embarrassed with the opposite sex   tongue tied totally frustrated desperately needing approval  i m quoting you doctor now let s hypothesise  the person whose approval he most needs is the young woman  who rejects him laughs at him goes out with someone else  is this someone who is going to remain benign  in those circumstances he could lash out  violently and uncontrollably until the object of his desire can reject him no more   yes it s possible  thank you doctor  sir joseph channing to see you my lord   we don t have an appointment  he apologises for calling in like this  all right  my lord   sorry to interrupt your meal john  there s some spare if you want it  good god is it part of the lcd cutbacks  just so there ll be no misunderstanding  i hardly think we could avoid those joe  i want you to be perfectly clear on what i m about to say  on the bench you are an irritation  most barristers would prefer not to appear before you  what you do there is sometimes fair sometimes just  but you are a prig a self righteous prig  you think that nobody else can deliver justice   well they can you know  yes i m sure  and when you re in the wrong you become a complete ass  as in this vendetta against robert home  oh you ve been elected spokesman have you  well perhaps i ve missed a beat here somewhere joe  perhaps somehow you re connected to this network of deceit  oh don t be ridiculous there is no network of deceit  the judges of england are impeccable  i ve known robert home for years he he s a member of my club i knew his father  well i suppose that s a start  there is no corruption  by your actions you put at risk the very last bastion of decency and integrity  where do these paragons get their immunity hmm  aren t they subject to human weaknesses like most of humanity  most of us went to decent schools we were exposed to the right values  for you to pursue this is to imbrute the bench  you must stop  if not for your own sake then for the sake of your daughter my granddaughter  for those you cherish your sister mrs mills and her family  your new girlfriend  you better leave joe  i m sure we ll reach an accommodation  the alternatives are too awful to contemplate  john this is a surprise   i m surprised to find you in  then why did you come   how are you  tired  i ve been reviewing jimmy darvall s trial something still doesn t add up   he s holding out on us  perhaps i should go and confront him again   yeah thanks boys okay  mark s upstairs online  i haven t spoken to tom for ages  you buy them phones so they can keep in touch and you re the last person they call  would you like to see a football match at the weekend  we could take charlie and the boys to brighton  john you don t like football  the lord chancellor wants the judiciary to have a more popular touch  what s wrong  nothing  nothing at all  i ll see you tomorrow  denis marlowe is not very happy about his transfer to aylesbury you know  why are they sending him to aylesbury  well it might have been the outer hebrides as far as denis is concerned  coop  is he unhappy enough to pull the prosecution papers  on the jimmy darvall trial for me  aylesbury s where i defended him  denis is very flattered that you remember him  most judges don t even know the polls exists  do we know whether gary patterson s recovered yet  he has he s ready to go back in the box  mr brill  do you know that on a previous occasion  mr patterson had confessed to a crime he didn t commit  i did see information to that effect my lord  did you disclose this to the defence  the cps took the view the information only confused matters  if the defendant were to be found guilty  failure to disclose might prove grounds for an appeal  nondisclosure is permitted under the criminal procedure and investigations act of 1996  yes but the test is applied by the prosecution it s subjective not objective  this arguably goes against the requirement for a fair trial under the human rights act  i m going to adjourn until after lunch during which time  i want full disclosure to the defence  of any previous confessions that mr patterson may have made  failure to do so might render any conviction unsafe  all rise  prosecution bashing john  how much does the 1996 act help the police row  every little helps we need all the help we can get  i ve heard back from gavin mcfayden  cps don t think there s enough in what charlie scraped up  john  well say something  it s  a disappointment  that s all   i could talk to the fraud office  no no no i don t i don t think so  the more people we talk to the more reputations we put at risk  john  john did you know something when you asked about the boys last night  jo are you all right you ve gone quite white   tom s in hospital came off his scooter  is he badly hurt  they re taking him to the theatre now i m on my way to york  why did he have to choose a university so far away  my car s outside i ll take you to king s cross   my junior can hold the fort  yes let me know how he is  you obviously have some very powerful and influential friends robert  one inevitably meets major figures in the course of one s career  what i haven t managed to work out  is whether they share your wonky ideas on victimless crime  or are simply supporting a fellow  either way i ve decided not to act on the corruption i ve found on the bench  with respect sir john i find that very wise reputations so hard won are easily lost  just pray that none of my family and friends has any more mishaps  or nothing will stop me  hmm  well argued  but a bit short on facts  it s an argument for why those judges and lawyers should be prosecuted   henry filled in some gaps  did he  as your law lecturer he should be teaching you to be factual  if the law fails you chaz then change the law don t try and bend it  do you want to eat  are we not gonna go after these guys  we can t  we all want to do it chaz we  we get frustrated we try to bridge gaps the law won t let us jump and um   can i keep this  mmm  where do you want to eat  i thought where carol works   let s try somewhere else  why  she really likes you dad  she s a waitress i picked up chaz now drop it come on  no i m not hungry any more  i can t go out with your friends to please you chaz   no  don t do that   jo how s tom  he s got great tarmac burns on his leg  he ll be fine i m waiting for row to finish a meeting then i ll come back   row drove you  he had a meeting with the york police   that was convenient  yes i ll see you in the morning  when you said you saw this other man kill geri and throw the iron bar into the pond  were you telling the truth   yes  that was the whole truth was it  yes it was yeah  you know the purpose of the court is to get to the truth mr patterson  yes  so when you previously told the police it was you who killed her was that the truth   no  ah  so you lied to the police is that so  yes  well mr patterson  how do we know you re not lying now when you say you didn t kill her  i m not i m not  earlier you said you lie so that people are kind to you did you not  i saw him do it i did i saw him do it  isn t this simply another lie  no you don t know i seen him do it  isn t it true mr patterson you hit geri again and again and again because she rejected you   no  you didn t want anyone else to have her   i didn t do it  you invented this other man  you invented him to cover up your own sordid crime  no i didn t that is the that s the truth i didn t  your truth mr patterson  is all strokes for folks  hmm  we ll let the jury decide  on the evidence  you wish to come back mrs mills  gary  how clearly did you see this other man on the night of the murder  i i saw him do it   were you spying on him and geri  no  were you following geri   yes  why didn t you try and stop him  gary  mrs mills  in the circumstances i have no further questions  are you calling your forensic expert  next my lord  dr markham did you examine blood on items of clothing belonging to the defendant  yes a pair of trainers and a pair of jeans  what were your findings doctor  there were two types of blood on the jeans but only one on the shoes  on the welts of the trainers the blood was from the dead girl geri lander  we did dna tests on the blood   is there any doubt about that  no  have you seen the report by the home office pathologist dr vaughan  yes i agree with his findings for the shoes but not the blood on the jeans  will you tell the jury how it varies   there are two separate bloods on the jeans  are these from the same type  yes type o  there wasn t much of either but the preponderance of blood  was from the defendant gary patterson   and the victim s blood  it was there but only as trace  can you say how the blood might have got there  the defendant s blood was pushed into the fabric as if wiped off something  the trace of the girl s blood was almost certainly picked up from brushing a leaf with it on  gary  gary can you hold up your hands  how did you cut your palm  it s just it s just from me sort of picking on it and just from scratches  i m pretty sure the jury didn t quite hear that  i do it sometimes with my nail   then wipe it on your trousers  yeah sometimes yeah  thank you dr markham   did tom say what happened  someone in a car forced him off the road  and didn t stop  didn t row colemore investigate it   what s on your mind john  nothing   i don t believe you  nothing  look  i got sent this from the prosecution file on jimmy darvall  a third party s blood was on the murdered woman s dress  mmm hmm prosecution didn t disclose it  i intend asking my ex father in law why  i should go down and see jimmy darvall  maybe row colemore ll give you a lift  yes john he might  the blood of a third party on the dead woman s dress means nothing in itself   it means that somebody else was there  not necessarily  the conviction is sound  peter hargreaves the senior partner in your firm of instructing solicitors  reviewed the prosecution s evidence and found it sound  hargreaves why didn t he tell me  presumably he didn t think it important  but then he must have seen the undisclosed evidence whose side was he on   he operated without prejudice  i m gonna get this before the ccrc   hello it s jo  jo  i think i know who killed jimmy darvall s wife  no i don t know jo  i don t know who did it it was all such a long time ago  you know exactly jimmy  you came into the bedroom that night and there he was  someone so shocking to you that you cannot bear to remember  you know who it was jimmy you know and you can see him you can  i thought i d invented him  i started to dream about marcus being there  your solicitor s younger brother   he was having an affair with your wife  she wanted it to stop  that s what i kept dreaming about her wanting marcus to stop  oh jimmy   he doesn t want to do anything are you serious mmm hmm   we can t stop now jo he could walk free  he s the client  he didn t batter his wife to death marcus hargreaves did  his brother peter reviewed the evidence and ignored it  jimmy feels he s culpable he doesn t want us to go on  he was stitched up  twelve years we ve been picking away at this  hargreaves can t keep getting away with it  john peter hargreaves is dead  tell your friends all bets are off   i don t understand  you don t  you re trying two lawyers on a so called victimless fraud  which like so many frauds that were tried and acquitted  tracks right back to westwake hargreaves  the late peter hargreaves that paragon of public accountability  masterminded the whole thing drawing in chums from his club and his lodge  that s you with peter hargreaves  tell your friends  there s only one way to stop them john make it official  fine just make sure you protect my people  my lord might you hear an argument out of the jury s hearing  concerning ownership of the glasses  perhaps i d better hear it in chambers  the glasses are a lens prescribed to dominic collins the chemist  did the police question him on that  he said he often mislaid his glasses geri lander was always finding them   and the police believed him  no reason to doubt him  they d have even less reason once patterson was convicted  the glasses are very strong circumstantial evidence but that s all they are  i am not going to allow you to introduce the ownership of the glasses  that s prejudicial to my client s case  no it s been clearly established that he s not the owner of them  my lord you know how hard it is to expunge prejudicial information from the minds of jurors  deal with that in summing up  you have before you a very difficult task  a most onerous responsibility  this is a young man charged with the most serious offence in law  he will suffer the inevitable consequences of a conviction  that is a very heavy burden for you  consider the facts carefully when coming to your decision about his guilt or otherwise  the burden is on the crown  the crown must satisfy you so that you are sure  and if they have failed to do that then you must acquit him  i doubt if the jury will come back quickly if they do i ll be in judge home s court  members of the jury  you have diligently and scrupulously examined  all the reams of evidence the prosecution has placed before you  now we must consider what it amounts to  not a lot i think you will agree  there is no crime here  what are you doing here   same as you dad what we have is a sin the sin of envy  envy of two highly successful lawyers  who were making the most of their business acumen and a loophole in the law  one which has now been plugged  but at the time most of these mortgages were written  the law read very differently  who was being hurt by this so called crime  no one  certainly there are no losers because there are no victims  the plain truth is that there wasn t any crime  you are such a perverse man you were warned about embarking upon this foolish course   sometimes we have to do as conscience dictates uh huh there will be consequences  oh i thought these were decent people who went to the right schools and clubs  yes well unfortunately that is no longer the guarantee it once was  money has such a corroding effect upon people  do you want to give me the names of these people  just be careful  oh by the way you may want these  the relevant prosecution papers from the darvall trial  thanks joe  do you think the jury will come back with a verdict before the end of the day  i doubt it judge   row colemore  row it s me  what are the chances of opening an old murder case do you think  miss  excuse me miss  what do you want  where s the usual friendly smile then  look i ve had a tough day at college  you re cross with me  charlie did warn me about you  i ll have to have a talk with charlie  how about some coffee when you get off  please   row colemore  row it s john  i m at carol hayman s 9 cooper s yard have you got that  yep 9 cooper s yard  get some of your people here as fast as you can we ve had an uninvited visitor   what you mean a thief  no i don t think he was a thief   we ll get someone over right away  fast as you can row  john what s going on   you had a burglar  but you just said he wasn t  i said he wasn t a thief  it s all right love it s okay  it s all right  that was quick   who are you  who are you  i ll ask the questions we have a warrant to search this flat  sure you do get your hands off her   let me see it  are you the owner of the flat sir  no she is can i see the warrant   you better tell me who you are  do you have some identification   you re very confident for a dealer skip  what s this then eh   john what is that  drugs at a guess   these yours sir  do you have the warrant  oh what a surprise signed by judge home  hello john it s more police   ask them where they re from  just a moment  on the first floor  you better have a very good explanation as to where your information came from  so had judge home  sergeant i m ds branson from the drug squad you got a cell empty   who for  two suspected drug dealers  fine where are they  can i help you my lord  yes call dac colemore and then your superintendent in that order   you know him  is this a joke that s mr justice deed  the cocaine found in the loo in carol s flat  was traced to a supply being held for evidence in a police store in london  and the policeman  well their informant seemed sound we re questioning him now   you were lucky john  i know   high court judge caught in drugs raid  by the time anybody looked behind that headline my reputation would be ruined wouldn t it  the jury s coming back judge   any feelings coop  not on this one judge  will the foreman rise  in respect of the defendant gary patterson  on the count of murder have you reached a verdict  we have  how do you find guilty or not guilty  not guilty   but i didn t kill geri  that was the verdict gary  but it does mean that somebody else killed her doesn t it  you said that you wanted the police as your friends  so why don t you trust them and tell them what you clearly saw  that s the only way we ll get justice for geri who i m certain had a genuine fondness for you   you think about that gary  yeah  all right off you go   whose earring was it  dad s  no i m no well  no it  talk to the police gary  all rise  did we have an appointment  we ought to have had long before this  the lord chancellor s pleased you take such an interest in his judges  but he expressed a view that you should have come to the department  about any concerns you may have had  and what would the department have done about them  that is a hypothetical now john  your interference has rendered any sort of legal action against judge home  null and void  you can stop the trial change the judge  what sort of signal would that send about the judiciary  did you imagine we d put him on trial  the attorney general will do the only thing he can do in the circumstances  he ll issue a nolle no case to answer  he ll walk away scot free  come to us in future john  the department manages the judiciary  and has been doing it remarkably well for a very long time  let s have lunch quite soon  mrs mills is here my lord   oh ask her to come in  she s already in   have you heard the news  they don t have news in the saturday papers  judge home tried to kill himself   how  in his car with a hosepipe  oh  poor man how is he   recovering  i feel entirely responsible  excuse me no one is ever responsible for another person s actions   lf i hadn t confronted him  someone else would have  it s such total self absorption to think otherwise  do you think i m self absorbed  you re straightaway looking to beat yourself up  i know a cure for that  mark and tom are outside in the car  ask them to come in then  we re on our way to see brighton we thought you and charlie might like to go  football   what if i get to like it better than sex  half the nation does john  i m thinking of buying a house in france  oh how fabulous can i come and stay  don t talk with your mouth full darina you know your father wouldn t have tolerated it   i m sorry mummy  you re doing it again stop  does that mean i ll never see you again wilfred  it s just an idea daddy liked france  excuse me mrs hay chief inspector skinns is here   does he know it s lunch time  i told him you were having lunch  ask him to come in jean  perhaps he s caught daddy s killer  coming at lunch time is inconsiderate whatever his reason  did you bring the entire murder squad mr skinns  i m here to ask your children to accompany me to the police station  it s in connection with the murder of their father julian hay   are you arresting us  yes sir  my lord the council s prime objection to mr ball s licence application  is the likely increase in noise and lawlessness  that would inevitably follow licensing such premises  hold on is there evidence that people who attend lap dancing clubs  are less likely to be law abiding than those who go to other establishments   i don t have such information my lord  then why introduce it  it s generally known that such establishments attract low types  no you can t argue this without evidence  the entire basis for this objection seems to be on the grounds of good taste  lap dancing both exploits the women who do it and degrades the men who pay for it  but until the government becomes the good taste police  the appellant should be granted his licence  there is the question  of his erm suitability   mr ball does have a criminal record  that conviction was for assault when i was 19  yes thank you mr ball he s got a point ms tatchell  spent as it is my lord the conviction is nevertheless an index of character  one the licence granting authority cannot ignore  well i don t agree  francesca  this is a surprise  john a friendly face  who never got his calls returned  no we were doing neither of our reputations any good   i heard you left ian  yes a while ago   do you come here often is that your new chat up line  no no my car s gone  i m trying to work out what to do someone s taken it   you must call the police  yes  i m less worried about the car the papers in it were my life for the past year   he might not have gone very far  stupid to leave them in there   oh especially if they are irreplaceable  it s not that  i just don t have the energy to spend another year fighting her  come on i ll run you to the police station  sorry i hate showering at the gym  this should be compulsory reading for judges  how to reverse the ageing process  oh uh i m trying to find a way of solving a problem for my aunt   she have alzheimer s  she gets very confused  what does her doctor say  well that would be something to know aunt dottie   she won t let him examine her  well how does she run her publishing empire  well a lot of the magazines are losing money  my cousin giles and i do most of the day to day stuff  he can be as difficult as aunt dottie he doesn t want me get her help  he wants to take over the company   is there gonna be anything left to take over  a lot of property  print works at blackfriars office blocks in mayfair   half the sea front in brighton  oh well  what are you gonna do with all this research then  i really don t know would you like some coffee  mmm no  sorry  i m still a bit confused   since my separation mmm hmm yeah well it takes a long time  yeah   you planning to divorce ian  yes  he doesn t want me to there s a clause in a will  he ll forfeit some family money  i ve got a conspiracy trial starting a lot of reading to do so  well um you know where i am  edward rex hay  wilfred adrian hay  darina rose hay  you are charged jointly that on or about the 18th of may last year  you conspired together and with one kevin helyer  to murder julian hay and mary hay   how do you plead  not guilty and for wilfred and darina  mr hay your bother and sister must enter their own pleas  not guilty  not guilty  you may sit down   none of you represented  no my lord i m representing us  mr hay although you are a solicitor you cannot legally represent your brother and sister  they can if they so wish adopt your defence  i would urge both them and you to reconsider finding representation   we don t need to my lord  how do you feel about that miss hay  i m happy with ed   and you mr hay  i agree with darina  well you re free to change you mind i will assist you in any way that i can  mr mason allen are you ready to open for the prosecution  my lord we re psychologically disadvantaged in conducting our defence from the dock  could we move to the defence bench  i only have the power to allow this if i can persuade the dock officer   being here presumes guilt  well hardly but it s a fair point   are you agreeable to that  we ll have to sit behind them sir  yeah fine  mr james the judge is still sitting  it s you we wish to see mrs cooper  the department is thinking of moving you  well you can t i m with mr justice deed  we can t  it s time to remind you what your precise function is here  shut the door  during the course of this case  you ll hear and see things i m sure you wished you hadn t  a plot to murder  two loving parents  was hatched by three children who had had every advantage  who cunningly  hid their malevolence towards their father and mother  who calmly ate lunch with them on the day of the killing  knowing the burglar they had hired  for 20 ooo  was on his way to kill them   oh hi  she s so happy  oh yes she should be a police dog she s open to bribery  yes thank you officer   you want a drink  had two already  i should give it up if i were you  you all right  i m pregnant  ah  you sure  about 98 percent according to the test instructions  how do you feel about it   it s quite exciting  glad you think so  i mean what would i do with a baby  i mean every moment of my life is taken up i can t keep it   can t the father help  i m thinking of having a termination  well that s quite a big decision chaz shouldn t we talk about this  no we shouldn t i   i don t have any choice  life offers loads of alternatives nowadays  i m not gonna give up law  well women have careers and children   yeah well they don t get to the top  your mother did  what does the father have to say about this  it s henry kuhle the lecturer i was seeing   look i ve made up my mind  then unmake it chaz think some more  it s no big deal dad i don t need your permission   you need my financial support  great  control always comes down to the one with the money  i expected that from mum and neil not from you  thanks for nothing  why she she tore past me like a greyhound  you never quite get it right do you  so uh are you still living with jeff  sir ian do you have a moment  not really no thank you  mmm  we ve been reviewing some of mr justice deed s cases   there appears to be serious misconduct  oh i have no doubt laurence   oh what was it you discovered  a case before deed last year  he directed the jury to acquit a doctor accused of murdering her elderly patient  he subsequently denied having an affair with dr bellew  aha  the problem is there s no way we can sanction a high court judge in such circumstances  there is a precedent  in 1805 lord melville was impeached for high crimes and misdemeanours  200 years ago  i admire your tenacity in wanting to bring this recalcitrant judge to book  but it s a sledgehammer to crack a nut and a high risk strategy at that  there is something else sir  it involves lady rochester  speak freely you know the situation  it seems she s resumed seeing deed sir  she was at his court then later he was at her apartment  have you been spying on her  we ll explore the more usual channels for undermining judges  mps asking questions pressure from senior judges   tabloid press exposure  sir  laurence under the circumstances i mustn t be seen to be involved  do you want me to talk to charlie  if i thought it would help i d even ask her mother to  although i suspect george would stick her in a taxi and take her to the clinic herself   at least you d know it was done properly  i don t want it done at all jo  it s not your decision john  well i thought you of all people would have understood  we can t change what was by trying to dictate what should be now   we have to step back and learn to let go  she s making a huge mistake  and you re not helping  are you trying to make a complete fool of me  you ve seen john deed again   you still spying on me ian  i wouldn t demean myself  if you don t like my behaviour  then divorce me  you know what that means under my family s will  then you have to agree to give me half the money  charlie  charlie please call me we need to talk   that was quick  was it  i thought it was my daughter  i got my papers back my cousin giles had   borrowed my car   did you tell the police  yes they were perfectly sweet  well they would be they can chalk it up as a win  so maybe i ll bump into you at the gym again  i don t know when   what a pity  look i m making dinner   have you eaten  no  will the research papers help you with your aunt  i m sure there s help to be had if she wants it   is she a danger to herself or others  no i don t think so  well if she s ruining her business her employees are gonna be out of work  some sort of action might be needed  i don t know what to do for the best  it s sometimes hard to see when you re so close  i lied i ve already eaten  how scandalous my lord  i wanted to see you again  this is john deed leave me a message please  look i can t let you dictate my life  just because you have some romantic notion about me being a mother  forget it  chief inspector can you tell the jury how you came to arrest the three accused  a chance call from the uniform branch  they d arrested a burglar called kevin helyer who was looking for some help  meaning what chief inspector  he was looking for a lesser charge  his burglary was similar to the one committed where mr hay snr died  having been linked by dna to that death  helyer wanted to use the opportunity to get a lighter sentence  did the cps offer to trade with him  i believe there was an arrangement  was this confession induced by promise of a lighter sentence  no my lord  did helyer do other than confess to the killing of julian hay and assaulting mary hay  yes he said he was lured into this conspiracy by his solicitor edward hay  by his solicitor s brother wilfred and his sister darina  we should hear this from mr helyer himself mr mason allen  mmm yes thank you chief inspector  chief inspector  i believe the burglar kevin helyer who confessed to killing my father  was given an eight year prison sentence is that so  yes he was  this light sentence was a result of some special arrangement with the cps  he confessed to manslaughter mr hay  the trial judge would have had the greatest discretion when it came to sentencing  yes i know  after seven months  wasn t your murder investigation in fact at a standstill  when this confession fell into your lap  murder enquiries never stand still  before helyer s confession  did you consider us murder suspects  you were on my list   did you do anything about your suspicion  not initially my lord   did you know helyer was my client  not until his confession sir  or that he hadn t paid me   i assumed he d been on legal aid  you d have thought so  an unsuccessful burglar  and did he tell you i d threatened him over the money  no sir  were you intending to sue this unsuccessful burglar for recovery  no i threatened to divulge something i d learnt by way of a privileged communication  has this privilege been waived by your former client  well helyer has put it in his witness statement which is in your bundle my lord  item 2b in your bundle  i m obliged to you mr mason allen  my aunt sacked everyone all 147 of us  can she manage on her own  she says her spirit guides will help  huh do they have an editorial policy  if she s out of control you might have to bite the bullet  get her sectioned  put her in a loony bin i don t think so john  sometimes we have to be cruel to be kind  from the sound of it you either force help on her   or let the firm go  then the firm may have to go  why if it s a viable company   couldn t you run it  giles and i are running it  presumably without executive control  no i i couldn t do anything to hurt aunt dottie  save the company then your aunt   mrs mills is on line one judge  is it urgent  i didn t ask judge  jo i m in the middle of a con  i talked to a psychologist friend about charlie  good thank you look um i ll call you later  oh  you owe it to those employees francesca and yourself  thanks coop  no it would be too horrible for poor dorothy  something that doctors decide  look you need somebody reliable for this  jo mills would do this sort of thing with great tact  but it is very minor for a silk a junior would be cheaper   well if you think jo would be best  well i can talk to her  your solicitor will have to instruct her  you can t be serious i thought you asked me here to talk about charlie  let your girlfriend sort out her own mess i can t get involved  why does her case lack merit  you re my closest friend jo the person i trust most in all the world  whatever you decide i know it will be for the right reasons  you make it so hard to say no   is the coffee drinkable  i don t know i don t drink it  john as mrs mills is here there is a matter for concern   doesn t sound like good news michael  the lcd have been asking odd questions  i think that they re exploring the means of your removal  good job i ve got my lawyer with me then  this is serious john   on what grounds  i assume that they relate   to your relationship with mrs mills  we don t have a relationship  well not that sort anyway  i think the perception is the problem  you didn t hear this from me  how do you sleep at night  you have a short memory   hello  hello it s jo mills  oh hang on   it s jo mills  she s early  it s francesca pull the door   are you early  we said 5 oo  my watch must have stopped   my cousin giles  who s just leaving  you could stay and tell mrs mills about aunt dottie  well why don t you tell her  it would help get this done with less pain  sharing pain only doubles it franny   is he angry about something  he doesn t want this   does he have a better solution  unfortunately not  i don t want this either but i don t know what else to do  your reason has to be entirely transparent  i have nothing to hide   we must be utterly frank  i will be   are you having an affair with john  ooh that s pretty frank  are you   is that what he said  i didn t ask  well my life s already far too complicated  charlie it s me me would like to see you or at least talk to you  stephen no stephen i m going to see charlie  what do you plan to do wrestle me to the ground   i could hang on to the bumpers judge  feel free  who do you think he s off to see tonight stephen  charlie what have i done   you just don t get it do you dad  i m a million miles off  let me make up my own mind for once  i m trying to be supportive   look do you want me to talk to henry  are you kidding  well would you rather i didn t care  you don t seem to mind how much anarchy you have around you  one thing you can be sure of charlie no matter what strokes you play  sooner or later your children will reproach you for whatever mess they get into   i m not in a mess  what do you call an unwanted pregnancy then  i would have thought you would have supported my right to choose  there is more to this than a simple choice  look i don t need a baby in my life right now  you might think it s fun entertaining  you can probably even take it on to the bench with you  as part of those ancient perks you high court judges have  i don t need it in my life  you have to let her go john  is that the extent of your psychologist friend s advice  charlie wants to run her life try letting her   your relationship might change  our relationship is perfectly fine  then why ask me about it  did you see francesca   did she call you  no  i decided to do the case i m not sure why  mr helyer can you tell the court why you are currently in prison  i m serving eight years manslaughter  for accidentally killing a man julian hay  did you do this on your own  without any prompting  no those three were involved  in what way were the defendants involved  ed asked me to kill his mum and dad   that s a lie  mr hay  it is   were you going to do this for free  no  ed paid me 20 ooo  isn t this an extraordinary thing  a solicitor inviting you to commit a crime  no no no don t take advantage mr mason allen  i do apologise my lord  well i told him i d already killed someone else so i guess he thought i was up for it  was that under client solicitor privilege  yeah the old boy had a heart attack when i broke in   did mr hay bring this up again  yeah he did  i think it was the third time we met up  yeah he wouldn t stop whining about what beasts his parents was   so he asked me to kill them both did you agree there and then  no not at first  but he said if i didn t he was gonna shop me for the other killing   he used that expression  yeah he did  in other words he used privileged information to blackmail you  i have warned you mr mason allen  you know you can t put a leading question in the examination in chief  i do apologise my lord mr helyer  was it your intention to kill the defendant s parents  no i was just planning to scare them  but the old boy panicked when i tied him up  yes he suffered a cerebral haemorrhage i believe  yeah well i didn t know that did i until afterwards  and what was mr hay s reaction  well he didn t wanna pay the second whack cause i ain t done his mum  you received a puny eight years for killing my father  seriously assaulting my mother  as well as killing another person   you re lucky not to have three life sentences  my lord   mr hay please confine yourself to questions  i m sorry   it is my father  yes i understand the emotions involved  this is the problem with doing the case yourself  why is it you were dealt with so leniently  the police believed my story  could it be because you had dragged three innocent people into this odious conspiracy  one you dreamed up to mitigate your own vile deeds  no you hired me  you decided to rob my parents after i foolishly mentioned they were rich  you told me where you all lived  you re not only a murderer you re a liar  you took me to the house when they was out and you showed me the burglar alarm   you liar  you said they was making your life a misery   you filthy liar my lord   mr hay  he s a total liar  then show he is by questions in cross examination  your deal with the cps is a travesty of justice after what you did to two harmless old people  mr hay i accept that emotions are high but really you must confine yourself  i m sorry my lord  your interests and those of your brother and sister  might best be served by representation  i want him to suffer for what he did  i m sorry  would you like a short adjournment to recover yourself  he s not crying look at him they re pretend tears  just like when he told me what mummy and daddy used to do to him   please kevin you ve gotta kill mummy and daddy i ll give you anything   shut your filthy mouth shut it please kevin  mr hay this must stop now and you button it  either you take control of your emotions or you can continue from the dock  perhaps we d better get representation  would the jury go out please  do you need to discuss this with your brother and sister   no  i see  any objections mr mason allen  might this be achieved quickly  if barristers can be found and are prepared to read the papers over the weekend  we might resume on monday  my case collapsed  the defendant broke down in the witness box and confessed  ouch   you looking for work  yeah  the defendants in a conspiracy trial have abandoned their own defence   sounds like they need the fire brigade  isn t that what i taught you to be jo  18 years ago i expected life to become more sedate  sedate sounds like death  a doctor and a social worker have been to see aunt dottie uh dorothy lomax  she claims francesca and giles aren t related to her  francesca is the illegitimate child of her dead husband s sister in law   isn t that her niece  at a stretch  what francesca s relationship is to giles rowley   they re cousins  not according to aunt dorothy  he s apparently trying to develop a soft porn empire   did you believe her  i did find her lucid  the doctors found her rocky enough to section her  well she does go off to some pretty weird places  green street green where president kennedy is hiding out apparently  she s ruining a perfectly viable publishing business  it is her business john  if you were sitting on the court of protection  i daresay you could grant an epa on the nod here and now  and your girlfriend would have control  i thought you knew me better  i ve asked for a listing as early as possible aunt dorothy is the sole signatory at the bank  people haven t been paid  francesca should take power   i m not entirely convinced john  now why is that  she s saving 147 jobs  you asked me to do this i trust you but at times you can be a bit  naive  oh well  fortunately i m not hearing the case  you should go and meet aunt dorothy at the hospital you might find her interesting  give it back no no give it back oh no  i m not playing this game with you it s too juvenile   come on  no i m not  john  why didn t you call i might have missed you  i had some time off  you haven t met my cousin we were just off to see aunt dottie  she s given me a million and one things to do since she got incarcerated   is she gonna be pleased to see you  oh that s hard to know  look giles why don t you go on hmm   sure  i ll catch you later  what s your relationship with giles  we ve known each other for years  i think jo rather liked him   is he family  we re all the family dorothy s got  she sort of adopted him when he started working for her  his parents were killed when he was 18   you all right  yes fine  your husband s trying to pull me down   lan s a poor loser mmm hmm  could he succeed  depends how foolish i ve been  how dare he question your integrity  i ll call you as a character witness  i can give you some ammunition to lob at ian  he diddled aunt dorothy out of some property  oh i like the sound of that  i did try calling  i d have made dinner  oh i thought row colemore might be eating here  would you like to go in and check  you heard from charlie  she doesn t respond to my messages  yeah all right maybe i should cut her some slack  that would be a start  what is it john  i saw francesca earlier  there s something wrong there  i m not even sure if i like her  well something holds you   you know what my problem is  right now your love life is not my priority   marry me  and you ll stop all of this  reach your own decision  nothing i say will make any difference  what is she suffering from we haven t been able to ascertain that  her delusions vary in context duration and intensity  dorothy  you have a visitor dear  don t address me like your senile auntie  you re helping these people steal my business   what people mrs lomax  they won t get away with it   i ll tell my lawyer  what is it they re stealing from you  i ll see you all in jail for theft  okay um  who is your lawyer  no  if i tell you that you ll turn him against me  and then i ll have to stay in this dreadful place  the food is terrible the people are rude the whole place reeks of human detritus  thank god my husband isn t around   when did he die  oh he s not dead  he s hiding out at green street green   why is he doing that  well he knows what s going   who are you can i leave you with dorothy sir john  i loathe the patronising way they speak to one   do you know why you re here  oh yes  so that my niece and her boyfriend giles can steal my property   boyfriend  mmm  um  didn t you adopt giles when his parents died  well he insinuated himself into my life yeah  would you like a walk round the grounds  well francesca s definitely right  her husband did steal some property she thinks i don t know   why didn t you stop him  i don t always function quite at par  isn t it a good idea to get help  trouble is john the less i do myself the less i m able to do   people say i m a control freak  what does your husband say  oh no  i told you he was hiding out at green street green didn t i  mmm hmm  i don t know why i say that  it just pops out  well sometimes it s to do with mental overload you know  well i hope you re right once at a function with ian and francesca  i told the american ambassador that president kennedy was at green street green  what did he say  i think he thought i was crazy  anyway i made a mistake  should have been president nixon  hi this is charlie deed leave me a message  charlie please talk to me  i ve realised something important  you re right to want to decide things for yourself  so  i ll be in your favourite restaurant about 5 oo  it would be nice if  you decide  sorry   she s not gonna show up  carol  i m sorry i didn t see you when i came in  what you d forgotten that i worked here  do you know something i don t  she s gone to get a termination   when she didn t say  you d have tried to stop her   yes i did try  well maybe you didn t try hard enough  she didn t pick up the phone  sometimes that is the hardest thing for a woman to do even to her dad  i think she did want you to stop her  where did she go  i don t know  i don t believe you where s the clinic  look judge you re not in the courtroom now  i said i don t know and if i did i don t think i d say  yeah i m sorry i  just get me my bill will you please  oh don t worry judge you don t owe me a thing  where s charlie   oh sir john  where s charlie  how should i know  don t you think you ought to pay a bit more attention  you have a moral obligation if not a legal one i take it you are the father   i don t wish to discuss this  well shame on you  i hope you show a bit more backbone in your approach to law lectures  charlie knew i was married i told her when we started  yes very virtuous and what are you going to do now scurry back to your wife  yeah no look  charlie finished with me  i said i d support the baby charlie didn t wanna keep it  why what did she say  she s made up her mind   she s getting a termination  when   where s the clinic  i don t know  i believe it was somewhere her mother found  oh i thought it was neil telling me how late i am  if that s the tone of voice you use i d rather him than me  well what a coincidence john i d rather him than you   have you seen charlie  you know i have why else would you be here  why are you encouraging her to have an abortion  she s had it  it happens john it s not the end of the world  i think she was wrong  she s 21 she wants a life   is she okay  in the circumstances  you ll just have to learn to live with it the same as she will   i spoke to the father  how very last century  did you know he was married  someone s marriage vows haven t stopped you in the past   he said he d support her  i doubt it  he thought getting pregnant was immature of her  i would have supported her and the baby she knew that  did it never occur to you she might not want your help john  possibly she substituted henry for you  so what would you have me do nothing  sometimes that s all we can do  look she s not happy about what happened  she feels angry and stupid and sad but it was her decision  i can t believe that s what charlie wanted  will you look at your statement  it challenges the very possibility that it might for a moment be what she wants  no such thought crossed my mind  i know how you use words john  even this act to accommodate what has happened is domineering  she complained that you never restricted her or gave her boundaries  because you thought it uncool for a radical civil liberties lawyer  what would have happened if she d got into hard drugs as a result  she s far too intelligent for that  people a lot more intelligent than our daughter become addicts  i don t want her  to go away from me  what a pity i have to go  it s nice seeing you feeling out of control  george   was i really so domineering  was  did something happen for you to put it in the past tense  it s about time thought you were never gonna  oh hello  you seem quite at home  yeah why not  franny and i have known each other since childhood  have you where was that   eh  where was that  come on what is this  well can t you remember where you and francesca might have been kids  how about if we go and look in the bedroom would we find your clothes in the drawers  don t you think you re being a bit paranoid  you re not saying much to dispel it  look there s nothing between us okay we re cousins  what blood cousins  second cousins third cousins   you can sleep with your second cousin  we re not like that  what s your relationship with dorothy lomax   think carefully before you answer  i m not gonna put up with this  she says that you re an employee who insinuated himself into their lives   aunt dottie is off her head  i m not so sure   i m out of here  no you stay  i ll go you need to sort out your story with franny  nice car  what was it 50k  it s not mine it s a friend s  nice friend should introduce me  row it s john hi  do you think you could do me a favour  hi this is charlie deed leave me a message  ajournalist from the daily mail is here asking about you judge  do the lord chancellor s people know he s here  he is a she judge merigo henderson  a press officer from the lcd and laurence james are with her  they want to know if you could spare her some time   did we know about this  i wasn t warned  mr justice deed s  he s about to get into court hold on  dac colemore s outside   bring him through coop  i m on my way  hi this is charlie deed leave me a message  well  i didn t expect a reply in person  well i was in the county  uh we checked the ownership of that lotus  it s registered to a tim ball  nasty piece of work has a string of lap dancing clubs  well is that a coincidence i gave a ruling recently in his favour  anything here for us john  well i hope not  there s something else there s a journalist from the news of the world  who s been asking questions about our past relationship  oh no not another one  i hardly think that will excite their readership  well they know about my helping you out in that nightclub scrape   when i was a dc  how  it was 100 years ago   looks like someone s out to make mischief  i ve got a good idea who  with your leave my lord i ve been instructed by the defendant edward hay  to present his defence  my learned colleagues ms kneal and mr bushnell represent the other two defendants  good to see you again mr machin  lack of objectivity in the defence is not a concern i need to have any longer  are you ready to continue or do you want an adjournment  a short adjournment would be useful   shall we say till after lunch  much obliged my lord  perhaps after the adjournment you d all like to join the silk on the front bench  till this afternoon  all rise  mr james wondered whether you might spare the journalist a few moments now  yes bring them through  okay i ll come and get you   hello john  i wasn t sure i d get you  then why are you trying  oh oh you re cross  i m sorry i missed you last night i was at the office  going through the books the situation is far worse than i thought  yes well there s a lot going on right now  don t be cross please i don t know who else to turn to  giles has been taking money from the company  well if he s stealing try the police  he said he d borrowed it   where are you  i m i m at the office  trying to stem this money haemorrhage  can i see you  come to chambers about 5 oo  ms henderson from the daily mail judge  can i ask you a frank question sir john  is there any truth in the rumours that you started an affair with dr helena bellew  on the 19th of may last year  three days after you directed a jury to acquit her of the murder of one of her patients  that s frank  dr bellew went to your lodgings late at night i believe  you ve been talking to my butler  is it true  you have any more frank questions  would you say it was modern  for a judge to have sexual relations with a barrister who s appearing before him  i could caution you to publish at your peril  but i m more inclined towards wellington s famous dictum  why don t you give me your side sir john  i think you ve already written your story miss henderson  coop could you dig out the papers on dr bellew for me  i want to refresh my memory  mrs cooper how nice  let me guess what they are sir the papers in the dr bellew trial  sir ian rochester wants them  well mr justice deed has requested them  perhaps he plans to feed more gossip to journalists  he said sir ian wanted them  mr james  sneaking off like a thief with my papers  my lord  these papers are under my jurisdiction  we believe them to be court papers sir john  having requested them be brought to me it s the same as if they re on my desk  we are going to have the papers   not with my assistance  lf we refuse  we have several options  we could knock you down like any thief  we could call security  or we could have you locked in a cell for contempt  you take your pick  this is ridiculous sir john  this is utterly absurd call sir ian rochester  of course sir sorry sir judge s orders  john you cannot jail the circuit administrator he was doing his job  oh he ll stay where he is till he purges his contempt  no sir those papers are not yours and it is not contempt to take them  the act relates only to something done in the face of the court  i know what the act says and how to interpret it  you will release him immediately  oh so suddenly i m subject to the demands of the executive again  whatever happened to the unfettered administration of justice  we both know what this is about  the squalid little affair you re having with my wife  yes and what are you gonna do about it  i shall do everything in my power to maintain the integrity of the bench  meanwhile your man will make all the right noises to secure his release  i will instruct him to apologise  but only in order to stop the bench being brought into disrepute  but my lord we will have those papers  you could have had them straightaway if only he d had the good manners to ask for them  well the word is you re in serious trouble judge  what am i supposed to have done now   well i don t like to say my lord  go on  well you re supposed to be having an affair with mrs mills  oh  i thought it was dr bellew that was exercising their squalid little minds  you claim that mr hay suggested you might terrorise his parents  at which point did you decide that you might do this  are you kidding me he offered me 20k   would you do anything for 20 ooo  wouldn t you   just answer the question  how long did you think about it  i knew straightaway  you undertook for money an action which lead to the death of a man  well he was a beast  nevertheless a man you didn t know  they d already told me how evil he was all right and their mum  i mean after what they did to them i would have topped them for nothing  mr helyer this is an entire pack of lies a complete fabrication  with which you hoodwinked the cps in order to get a lesser sentence is it not  no it s not  first you claim you only intended to scare them now you d have topped them for nothing  i just told you they were beasts treating grown up kids like that  i mean darina was a bag of nerves  i mean she still wets the bed don t you darling  you an expert in parenting mr helyer   yeah i like kids  well tell us how you treat your own children   i treat em all right  is that why they were taken into care mr helyer  they were taken into care  look i know what s right okay  it s like when i was little when my mum used to hit me with a coat hanger  whack but that would be it  i mean she didn t go round degrading me like that lot  why were your children taken into care mr helyer  social worker had it in for me   which social worker was that  all of em  all seven who were involved over a period of three years   yeah they were all liars  whereas you only tell the truth  once they get their hooks into you right they never let go  it don t matter what you do nothing s good enough for em  what did they lie about mr helyer  you leaving a one year old and a three year old alone at night in a filthy cot  you breaking the three year old s jaw when you couldn t stop him crying  you just side with him cause he s got money all right  people like me don t stand a chance i mean they can get away with murder  i give my little boy a tiny little slap and i m hauled in  you did break your son s jaw  you only know what you hear from those lying social workers  i d like to kill them  did you take pleasure in killing mr helyer  well i d take pleasure in killing them put it that way  how did the cps make a deal with you  they said if i confess i d go down but i d be out in five or something  that seems indecently lenient i m going to ask the attorney general  to look at the inappropriateness of your sentence and see if he can find a way to make it longer  well you can t do that can you  cause we ve already got a deal  well you see the relevant test to decide if a sentence is too soft  is whether public confidence in the criminal justice system  could be maintained if the public were made aware of the circumstances  i think i know what the public would think mr helyer  so i m going to talk to the attorney about your sentence   no you can t do that  you just watch me  you can t do that look speak to him will you   be quiet  don t just stand there  be quiet or you ll be back in your cell right now  my lord this is a principal prosecution witness  i know very well what he is mr mason allen  mr machin would you like to continue  should i get the duty nurse judge  no my dignity was assaulted more than my person  perhaps you could get me some tea  you ve not forgotten mr james  oh yes i had actually  i wonder how he would have felt about a night in the cell  well he might get it yet  you think he won t apologise  he s got an awful lot of pride judge  perhaps i ll have my tea first  shouldn t we come down there sir ian  this judge is nothing if not bloody minded  i d feel inclined to do what you must from there  but we don t accept there was any contempt  regrettably we have to do it his way for now  all rise  what do you have to say mr james  we are very sorry my lord for behaving in an improper and disrespectful way towards you  it is not we who are in contempt mr james it s you  however i accept your apology  we do require the papers to carry out the proper function of our office  do you know i m not convinced that you re sincere in your apology mr james  perhaps a night in the local remand prison would make you more contrite  my lord we are utterly totally absolutely  irrefutably sincere in our apology  any offence we cause is wholly wrong and we are sorry for it  well if that s your last word you can go  on your way out if you call in at the list office  you will find that mrs cooper has been kind enough to photocopy the papers  all rise  what a splendid response john  i think that psychopath hardly expected a judge to punch back  can i expect a briefing from the lcd  if they re wise they ll keep well away  uh if you ll excuse me  wasn t that michael nivan  well i thought he was my friend as well as ian s  we all make that mistake when we separate from our spouses  thanks coop   aunt dottie said you went to see her mmm hmm  she was impressed   was she quite lucid  yes  when she is she can be tremendous fun  oh  of course aunt dottie s not the problem right now here  hi dad it s me  i saw the news i hope you re all right  yeah well um i expect you are  next message  john have you seen the news  they re all saying how manfully you dealt with the attack  it does make a woman feel secure  bye   i have to go  i ll give you a lift in case giles shows up  i don t want you to get drawn into this mess   what s his connection with tim ball  i don t know  i think ball put up some money for a skin mag when giles wanted to go it alone  it went down  now ball wants his money back  he s pressing quite hard  giles should go to the police  i think he s scared  oh  laurence did you see deed s press  his heroics got yards of positive publicity  not even the mail is interested in pulling him down now  he still behaved improperly sir  yes but if we continue to pursue him we ll appear vindictive  if we don t we ll appear foolish  then find a way to move forward  so that if it goes all pear shaped again only you look foolish mr james  boys sir john  sir john  i trust my lord you are fully recovered  i am mr mason allen thank you  let s put this into perspective the police face far worse attacks every day  doctors and nurses increasingly are attacked by patients  teachers likely as not  are attacked by students or parents  on the rare occasion that it happens to a judge  he receives an inordinate amount of attention  well with your leave my lord i d like to call dylan broadbent  who looks after edward hay s accounts at the bank  if you look at the bank statement for mr hay s client account  item 16a in your bundle my lord  you ll see two separate sums of 10 ooo withdrawn on the 10th and 19th of may  four days before the death of julian hay and five days afterwards   can you tell us who withdrew this money  yes edward hay  how was this money withdrawn  he asked for cash in small notes  thank you  ed hay made large cash withdrawals on a regular basis did he not   i don t remember  well let me remind you  if you look at the statements for the 5th of april the 29th of may and the 30th of july  the sums of five four and 10 ooo were withdrawn respectively   is that so  yes   did you know edward hay personally  we were quite friendly  i believe you went horse racing on several occasions  yes  did he win or lose on those occasions  he lost 7 ooo on one race  how did you get on   i don t remember  oh really  isn t it true you lost rather heavily  i i may have lost  isn t it true that you re a frequent gambler a frequent loser  not really  do you have an account at stokes and middleborough bookmakers  yes  is that a copy of your account statement   are you submitting this mr machin  i will be my lord   is that your account statement  yes  just prior to ed hay s arrest was there a disastrous hole in your personal finances  as a result of gambling one which you asked mr hay to plug in case the bank found out yes  it s got nothing to do with the bank  did you not borrow 8 ooo from ed hay s client account  money which he gave you in cash and was later waiting for you to pay back  yes i think the jury are ahead of us on this mr broadbent  someone is trying to get to you through jo  suggesting impropriety by her in dorothy lomax s affairs  there was none  what do you think about giles rowley  that smells like trouble he s had two drugs convictions  i don t have a relationship with him  you do inadvertently through tim ball  giving him his judicial review over his lap dancing bar licence could rebound on you   it bore no relation to anything  that isn t how it will look  at best it could be seen as bad judgement john  i ll ask again when exactly did the judge start his affair with mrs mills  when and how often did she stay the night  i don t know don t involve me  mrs cooper look at me  the note on our record  will state how you helped mr justice deed cover up his improper behaviour   and if it s not true sir  you know it s true mrs cooper  just as you know there will be grave consequences for you if you help him cover this  can you tell us about your relationship with the three defendants  ed and wilf and dari were always so kind to us  they couldn t do enough for their father and me  they loved us so much especially their father  mrs hay just  just think about that hmm  did you not say in your statement  that your children hated their father  and you for not leaving him  uh my lord my learned friend is leading and cross examining his own witness  well no i didn t say that  my apologies   i didn t say that  yes you  mrs hay  is this a lapse of memory  hmm  they loved us so much  their father s death was almost too much for them to bear  are you quite sure about that mrs hay hmm  quite quite sure  mr mason allen are you seeking to cross examine your own witness  my lord the witness   seems confused  would you like a short adjournment  to establish whose witness she is  that would be preferable to treating her as hostile my lord  very well until after lunch  your mother was potentially their most damaging witness  with her evidence collapsing it would be a mistake to go into the witness box  the state my mother s in i want to crush that liar helyer  ed everyone saw what he was  i d like to say something under oath ed  no dari i ll say all that needs saying  i wouldn t advise you to give evidence  i d like to speak to mummy  we haven t seen her since we were arrested  you can t at this point she is still a prosecution witness  i want to tell her how sorry i am  we re all sorry for the way she s been made to suffer as a result of our ordeal  prosecution has failed to make a case  let the failure stand  in view of the deteriorating health of my final witness my lord  that concludes the case for the prosecution  thank you mr mason allen mr machin am i going to hear from you  yes my lord there is a matter of law i should like to raise  all right jury go out  i submit there is no case to answer  kevin helyer the main prosecution witness could never be relied upon by a jury  the mother mary hay s evidence didn t come up to proof  and there is of course no discernible motive on the part of ed hay nor his siblings  i adopt my learned friend s submission  likewise  i need not trouble you mr mason allen  i see the force of your argument about lack of clear motive  but i think you know it s not a runner  there is direct evidence implicating the defendants  it is a matter for the jury summon them back in  i do not intend to call any witnesses   not even your client  no my lord  ms kneal mr bushnell do either of your clients wish to give evidence  no  mr hay i know your intentions i am trying to ascertain those of your brother and sister   they don t have to say anything  you must let them speak if they so wish   she s not well  i am i want to give evidence   you don t darina you re not well  mr hay  you know better than to interfere with a defendant s right to speak  if you continue you will be removed  does your client wish to give evidence mr bushnell  no my lord  would she prefer to speak without her brothers being present   it seems not my lord  i see  ms kneal  my client doesn t wish to give evidence   they have all been advised of the implications  they have  very well then are you ready to address the jury mr mason allen  i am my lord  no i think the morning will be more convenient  all rise  judge  oh hello what s going on there  is he giving him something yeah he s taking it  that s interesting  why didn t you telephone  would ve been sensible under the circumstances   well i don t understand  don t you  i m trying to work out exactly what it is that makes me want to believe you  in spite of evidence to the contrary  john you re frightening me   what was tim ball doing here  he wasn t  he just gave me his card  and an invitation to the opening of a new club   well he couldn t have  do you think i m completely stupid  giles brought him  they made me sign some documents  what documents  share transfers i think i didn t get a proper look  ball threatened me   we ll go to the police  no no please don t i m scared  come here  giles started stealing from me some time ago  small things at first and then property  francesca begged me not to prosecute  she said that the drug people who giles was involved with would kill him  i had some affection for them both once  giles helped me hide some of my lapses  it s terribly alarming when such an iron grip starts to slip john  perhaps i should just give up  do you know what property was involved and what was stolen  oh yes  every single bit  ooh your troubles with the lcd will pale into insignificance if this becomes public  francesca involved in stealing the old woman s property  no of course not  are you arguing that as a lawyer or a lover  do you think i m that bad a judge of character   have you questioned her about this  no why would i  why not you re good at going after the truth  she d deny it and i d probably believe her  oh john how can i save you from your foolishness  you know how  i am not convinced you would change  what about francesca  can you get somebody in chambers to check on those property deals  row colemore would do it for free  what emotions do to our lives  you struggle to live in the intellect where everything is circumscribed by reason  and all the time emotions drag you down into an undertow and you can t get free  we wouldn t be human without them  did you hear from charlie  no i was  thinking about the case i m hearing  three adult children possibly conspired to kill their parents and succeeded with one  and i don t think the prosecution has convinced the jury  so in all probability they ll walk  and looking at the children i can well believe that the father was a monster  but did he deserve to die  i think she s with her mother and neil haughton  have you got a list of properties giles is supposed to have sold  i really appreciate this jo  i should be with aunt dottie getting my head examined  this looks almost official row  coop give us one minute will you  how involved are you with francesca rochester  she s an attractive woman row  is it more than physical john  i had a call from an assistant chief constable down here  i had asked him to have his men watch giles rowley  one of his detectives has been passing sensitive information to laurence james  about your visits to francesca s apartment  go on  the property and shares you asked about owned by dorothy lomax  have been transferred by francesca under her power of attorney to tim ball  he and giles are threatening her  it gets worse you re implicated  sir  you ll have seen this  proofs of a four page profile the sunday times supplement is running on deed  they re making him into a national hero  he had an affair with a barrister before him sir  i don t care perversely  deed is becoming exactly what the lord chancellor wants in his judges  can we be seen to back down sir  i won t have the department made to appear foolish  there is something else sir ian  sussex police have been investigating the transference of property  belonging to dorothy lomax by lady rochester  the main recipient is a suspected drug dealer and night club owner tim ball  yes  lady rochester has transferred money to an offshore bank account held by deed  i can t believe it  as much as i despise deed i don t believe him venal  you all right judge  would you ask counsel to see me here before we start please  i ll get them judge  mr mason allen his lordship would like to see you in chambers  ms kneal mr bushnell mr machin his lordship would like to see you in chambers now   what is it heathcote  the judge wants to see us  no i won t allow it you mustn t speak to him out of my hearing  then i ll address them all without the jury  before we begin the closing speeches  do either of you wish to take this last opportunity to address the court  darina  wilfred  i m sorry mummy  we didn t mean to hurt you or daddy  ed said he would scare daddy and pay him back for all the beastly things he did to us  we just meant to scare him  we didn t know ed had paid mr helyer to kill daddy  she s not well darina she s not mr hay shut up and sit down  darina did you meet with mr helyer the man who killed you father  yes  he came to our house   when mummy and daddy were out at bridge  shut up  shut up damn it you stupid stupid girl  mr hay i will not warn you again  you must not bully your sister  did you discuss killing your father with mr helyer  no  he said he would tie him up and put him in a cold bath  we wanted to punish daddy for all the horrid things he did to us  wilfred is this true  yes  helyer said that he would tie him loosely so that mummy could untie him  we often wished daddy dead after he d humiliated us for the millionth time  we didn t mean it we didn t   will they plead guilty jo  it s all they can do  i expect the judge will come down hard on ed hay and give the other two a slap on the wrist  could those parents really be as bad as the children made out  makes my complaints about dad seem so stupid and futile  everything s relative charlie  i just wanted to make an important decision by myself  i know  i had a termination once  i still dream about that baby sometimes i wake up seeing him  he d be 14 now and you would have a half brother  did dad know  he drove me to the clinic  so why didn t he say  my husband was terminally ill had been for some time  i think john regretted it as much as i do  justice deed s chambers  one moment please  lady rochester  he s in court lady rochester  thanks coop oh charlie s outside judge  good bring her through will you no i ll get her myself  oh john john  more bad news michael  i just had a word with ian rochester  it seems that they ve dug up a matter of criminal substance  your acquisition of property from dorothy lomax  yes i m looking forward to seeing the evidence  well he s asked for a free and frank discussion in his office  as presider he s asked me to be there  good then i won t need defence counsel  how are you  um  i ve been um  jo told me  about you and her  why didn t you say  not my finest hour  yeah i know  wasn t mine either  when jo told me about her decision i was so relieved  i ve regretted it ever since  john why didn t you return my calls   i ve been busy  we have to talk urgently  you have to help me john  i don t think i can  how s aunt dottie  there s a criminal investigation do you know about it  i m sure you can blame everything on giles  she got terribly upset during her niece s visit  oh you ve got to get me out of here   well who would look after you  well if i stay here i lose everything   everything is taken care of  no no no it s francesca  francesca s just had me sign some documents saying i m transferring to her all the property  no no no you can t do that under the section order  oh she predated it before my section  if you understood that why did you sign  she said i d die in here if i didn t  you re not gonna die in here dorothy i won t let you  i cling to her word hoping she will keep it and she doesn t  she s incapable of doing so  she can t leave sir john she s sectioned  i see people in tesco s madder than she is  the only way she can be released is on the recommendation  of the mental health review board   they don t sit for another two weeks  well that s too late  i ll issue a writ of habeas corpus  jo it s john are you in the mood to do me yet another favour  i doubt it especially since you got me out of the bath   could i come and join you  hmm was that the favour  i ve just seen dorothy lomax  i want you to bust her loose  oh yes and how might i go about that  get her before a district judge carmen for preference  there is a precedent for ending sections longman and the derbyshire health authority  and what will you do if i succeed  get all her property back from those thieves and parasites  john i m on my way  row it s john  do what you have to do  my lord we were due to start at 10 oo  my lords it is now 10 past  yes mr james  we re waiting for sir john s representative to arrive  that person might have shown the court the courtesy of being here promptly  this isn t a court mr james nor does it have jurisdiction as such  it is an informal review my lord it ought to be shown respect  and on its conclusion   what authority does it have to deliver sanctions   hello  john it s row   this is most discourteous  what are you going to do impeach me  yes row  sussex police have just arrested francesca rochester and giles rowley  do they have enough evidence oh yeah  the pair of them have been fleecing the old woman s company systematically  with the help of their solicitor   he can t stop talking  i ll tell sir ian  what about tim ball  at the old lady s house auditioning lap dancers how s it there  ooh no less exciting   come in i ll tell you at lunch   i believe you know your wife s aunt  sir john this is not open to the general public  oh don t be idiotic ian  is there a reason why it should be in secret  the reason is to protect your good name  oh i think it might be to protect you and the lord chancellor  i m gonna make a brief statement about the facts on the indictment   hardly an indictment  oh i thought it a matter of criminal substance  after my statement i m going to ask this lady to speak for me as a character witness  now this procedure was started because of my alleged affair with dr helena bellew  after i had directed a jury to acquit her of murder  then allegedly with mrs mills these ploys failed to run  so you switched the accusations to the improper acquisition of property from this lady  i did no such thing  my serious error of judgement was in assisting your wife  to have this lady sectioned in the first place  but that s not really why we re here is it   it s precisely why we re here sir john  then where is your evidence  the funds you hold as an offshore account  paid to you by circuitous means by one timothy ball  this is absolute nonsense  well perhaps you would tell us sir john how the proceeds of property  belonging to lomax publishing came recently into your account  i suspect it was transferred there by francesca rochester  giles rowley and their solicitor in order to implicate tim ball or to compromise me  why she would do that i haven t the faintest idea  they ve been illegally transferring property out of my holding company for years  you know dorothy everything was done for your benefit  nothing illegal has occurred  look i don t think we need hear this michael  perhaps we should as it s informal  with one or two lapses  i ve been running my publishing company quite successfully for 40 years  until my incarceration  and while i was locked up a number of my properties were transferred to a trust  and sold not to my benefit others have been filched in exactly the same way  they all thought i was potty and imagining it  my niece and her boyfriend giles bear most of the responsibility  and so do you ian  this is monstrous  you have known for a long while  that francesca s lifestyle and expenditure was way in excess of your income  and yet you chose to turn a blind eye  nothing illegal has occurred   did you put her up to this  i wish i had  i won t sit and listen to these lies  you must let her continue ian  and having realised his mistake  mr justice deed had the courage to put things right immediately  he started a police investigation  he wasn t concerned about the cost to him personally  and nothing you try to do can diminish him  the police have the evidence and all the property will be recovered   i don t know what you re talking about i hope for your sake that you don t   try calling your wife she ll fill you in  i will  michael  if there s to be a police investigation ian  it would be better to close this informal hearing now  jo s told me all about you john   has she  mmm  she needed information for your defence  would um would you like to come and stay at my place  let s find out if you ve still got a place first shall we  oh it doesn t matter no one s gonna mind if i move into your digs  give me a new lease  jo  jo   hello boyd where on earth are you  i m on brookbean road  what are you doing down there i thought you were coming home  i m going to danny s i did tell you  what about your homework boyd when are you going to do it  i m gonna do it when i get to danny s i will   no mummy no  give us it give us it   hey that s my phone  boyd boyd   hey that s mine give it  what s happening boyd  give it him let him have it  are you all right son son can you hear me  he stole my phone  i think he s been stabbed  mr ryder  you are patently not a bad man  and it s possible that your actions may have helped to protect many commuters  however in most of these instances you acted as an agent provocateur  intentionally attracting muggers to yourself  i accept that it wasn t your intention that any of them should die  but one did  so the verdict of manslaughter was the right one  i commend you for staying at the scene of the crime  until the police and ambulance arrived but it is appropriate that you should go to prison  shame  first i would like pre sentence reports  no there s no point in asking for bail mr connors  three weeks mr clark  all rise  that decision s not going to make you very popular judge  i don t pander to public opinion   well you could release him into the community  community service i don t think so  you could devise a scheme where you release him into the community   in the care of others  not my job it s the home secretary s   charlie phoned she d like you to call her  yeah i know what that s about  the hunger striker  he was convicted for conspiracy of firebombing halal meat trucks  this was politics dad proving the crown isn t racist  well he s probably not the only one who doesn t like the way muslims slaughter their animals  but muslims have rights too under the law don t they  the law that permits these ritual killings completely contradicts  the 1911 protection of animals act  now this extends to every single high street butcher shop  dad   have you tried your grandad  oh he s so stupid  to the right of richard nixon perhaps stupid no  the appeal s only part heard they ve yet to give a ruling  grandad wants to be a law lord  he s gonna rule against richard jones   we can t just let him die  isn t that his choice  supposing i said i was gonna go on hunger strike what would you do   i d try to stop you you re my daughter  yeah well he s someone s son  do you really think we should care less just cause we don t know him  don t we care more for our own  yeah that s why we go on tolerating  what s happening to animals and people in the third world  because they re not our own   john charlie how are you  fine  john someone s coming in for an injunction  i m going to glyndebourne can you deal with it  if it s not too complicated i m hearing the opening in the cell phone murder   it involves a child needing a new heart  okay  i trust your college work s keeping you busy charlie  either that or i m just very slow  i have told you about the lord chancellor s files haven t i  yeah the system where everyone reports on barristers who want to be judges  on all lawyers law students as well  your clever remark to the presider will have been noted  look if the law can t help richard jones  well i don t wanna be a lawyer   you coming to see me  michael nivan i think   for the injunction  yeah  it s me  jason powell doesn t want the transplant  although he is only 15 he is sufficiently mature to understand the consequences of that decision  and it ll cost him his life  he doesn t want the heart or to have to live on drugs for the rest of his life  his parents consent to the operation doesn t seem unreasonable  oh it wouldn t be if he were five  and the operation can t wait  a heart s become available the hospital are pressing the parents  there s no clear precedent that favours the parents and disfavours the child  he can lawfully decide his own fate if he truly understands what s happening  there s no doubt about that  all right i ll grant the injunction pending a full hearing first thing tomorrow morning  can you alert all parties to be ready by 9 oo  do you want some food  i should get back the hospital might make a pre emptive strike  they wouldn t dare coop will call them  thank you coop  you all right  you look a bit done in  why are you taking this on you re before me in the cell phone murder  this is momentous john  it won t diminish for you taking 15 minutes to eat come on  how can you do this what if it were your son needing a heart  then i d probably feel like you do mrs powell   then why are you doing it  mel don t make a scene it doesn t help   you re useless at times like this  mrs powell  we re here to represent jason s views   he has to get that new heart  the judge has to decide  jason s going through an animal rights phase we never thought it would come to this   why don t we go outside  no it s my son s life  god i hate them it s just a game to them all  could you find out if there s any change in the condition of that hunger striker in prison  well do you need to know now they re ready for you to hear the injunction  when you ve got a moment  those of you not familiar with family division  this is less formal than others courts but no less serious  we are to hear why the injunction preventing jason powell  from receiving a heart transplant should or should not be lifted  it has to   are you the mother we will get to you  he does need this new heart  no decision will be taken until we ve heard from you mrs powell  but it can t wait he ll die  i understand your concerns we must hear the arguments  so i suggest that we hear a statement from both sides  and then we ll hear any witnesses are they present   and you are  this is malcolm evans sir  consultant of cardiac surgery at brighton st james s  i m dennis jordan sir for the parents  there is evidence from the national transplant unit  about the scarcity of hearts this we are submitting in writing  thank you   mrs mills  we will be calling orlando figes  he s a hospital social worker who talked at length with jason powell  good  we d best hear first from those opposing the injunction  our case my lord is based entirely in law  jason powell is a minor and as such falls entirely under the protection  of his loving and caring parents andrew and melanie powell   their position in law is unequivocal  i d be interested to hear that mr jordan  i thought the law sensibly considered that parental rights terminated  provided the child could demonstrate sufficient intelligence and understanding  to fully comprehend the consequences   yes  that was lord scarman s view  yes we would argue that those circumstances do not exist in this case  therefore the parents have the right to decide  i would direct your lordship to re r 1991 volume 4  of the all england reports at 177  the dispute concerning a girl aged 15 and 10 months  lord donaldson the master of the rolls  stated that medical treatment can be administered to an under 16 year old   even if the child is legally competent to refuse consent   consent can be given by someone who has parental rights or responsibilities  my lord jason powell is a 15 year old with all sorts of unrealistic  he became obsessed with the animal rights lot  we will get to you mrs powell  while accepting that parents have rights over decisions about their children  we argue that this has ceased to be the case with jason powell  here is a young man who at 15 years 11 months of age  is mature and wise beyond his years  he s reasoning and highly articulate  in deciding not to have a heart transplant  he has done so after having weighed all the available evidence  he is sincerely committed to the position he has adopted on animal rights  he asked me to inform the court that he sees no logic to his life being extended  at the expense of animals sacrificed  to further develop drugs to prevent his body from rejecting the heart  jason meets every criterion set out by lord scarman  the rights of the parents cease if and when the child achieves  sufficient intelligence and understanding  one five minute conversation with jason tells one he has  in his own words the exploitation of one species   opens the way for the exploitation of all others  not the words of someone incapable of making a rational choice  or following a fad as his parents suggest  thank you mrs mills  this case is more complex  than i had originally believed and i have another trial waiting  before proceeding further i would like to meet with jason  he s in intensive care  mr evans will he survive a further 24 hours without this transplant  any delay is detrimental  but 24 hours i don t feel will prove critical  would you arrange for me to meet with jason after adjournment today mrs lawson  we should be there  with respect my lord there must be the opportunity  for all parties to witness the interview  yes via a video link until 9 oo am tomorrow  my apologies for the delay in resuming this morning  i had a complicated injunction to hear  can we have the jury  the case before you is both tragic  and brutal in equal degrees  it involves two self confessed drug addicts  who in order to feed their habit  mugged a young teenager boyd payne for his mobile phone  this he had worked hard for at weekends  and saved all his pocket money to buy  courageously and with great spirit  boyd resisted his robbers until one of them  the man on your right in the dock david dwarf lavender as he s known  egged on by the other defendant paulo dorrell  stabbed him five times in the stomach with a serrated paring knife  causing wounds that were to prove fatal  when that blood come out of his mouth i thought we was dead   and what did you do then mrs histon  i held him  i couldn t let him lay on the pavement it didn t seem right  were you later able to identify the two men who stole boyd s phone  yes well one of them the one who stabbed him i heard the other one  did you hear him clearly  yes he said give it him dwarf let him have it before we re nicked   who said this  the one in the car  so that the jury are quite clear about who did the stabbing  and who egged who on  can you point out the defendant who did the stabbing  and who you subsequently identified at an identification parade  the one on the right  please stand up mr lavender  are you sure that this is the man  he was dirtier but that s him  were you able to recognise the voice of the man you say you heard encouraging lavender  yes i heard it on tape  my lord i will be calling evidence from the police inspector  who conducted this voice identification  the voice mrs histon picked out  number six   number six was paulo dorrell  is this disputed  it s disputed that he s the man  not that mrs histon picked out his voice  that s what i meant sir james as you well know  let me put a hypothetical to you mrs histon  the death penalty has been restored  a guilty verdict will send these two young men to the gallows  would you still be as certain   i think so  is that enough  think carefully  you were walking along the street chatting to your partner  he saw nothing until the boy was on the ground and the car was speeding away   he heard him shout  but not what was shouted  you on the other hand happened to be glancing in the right direction   you were glancing in the right direction  yes  how long for a second two seconds   could have been longer  it could have been shorter  did you really see all that happened  or did you subsequently piece it together based on what the police had told you  make sure we don t get clamped  the camera s set up in jason s room sir john   does he mind  he doesn t stop asking questions  i can t answer most of them  procedures drugs how and when they were tested  i m sure i didn t know half of them were tested on the poor wee animals  the judge is here jason  ring the bell if you want anything sir  compassion the ultimate ethic  it s not exactly light reading  dad says i should be reading harry potter or lord of the rings   have you read those  yes  they re okay neither s got a workable or consistent philosophy  isn t that something we develop along the way  if there s time   do you know why i m here jason  mum told me  she s along the corridor at the video link  she s very concerned about you   she doesn t want you to die  nor me  that s what s going to happen if you go on with this  i don t want anyone or anything killed just so i can survive  like who  the girl whose heart they want me to take for a start  the donor s brain dead jason she s not coming back  not if they take her heart she isn t  brain stem death was something they thought up in 1995  when they couldn t find enough donors  parents can t imagine the possibility even  of surviving their children  that s probably why so many of them respond so generously  after the worst possible tragedy  by donating their children s organs  not thinking what it costs in animal lives  the techniques and drugs are already developed aren t they  they still go on testing  there are laws to protect animals  they re seen as property owned by humans  when jesus said suffer those who be as little children to come unto me  he wasn t just talking about my kind   so hurt not therefore one of these little ones   for whom the heavenly father mother careth   if anyone hurts or destroys one of these little ones   it would have been better for that one had he never been born  sayings of the master  don t we have dominion over the animals  which means a duty to protect them  laws are in place to protect them from abuse  we abuse the animals every day exploit them for food and clothing  neither of which is necessary to our survival  we use them to test chemicals medicines  we do this with compassion  no that s how we justify the abuse  the animal doesn t know for what noble purpose it s suffering  or if it will ever stop  countless people have benefited jason  no one benefits from theft and murder  that s what it is  life has been pretty miserable since i was struck down with this  i think what it might be like going to university  having girlfriends even playing for man u  you could still do most of those things  do you think it s right for people in the animal rights movement to use violence  to further their cause  it s not right in any cause  it s better to suffer or to be oppressed than to raise a single stone against the oppressor  hmm  how do you think your parents would cope with your dying  if they know that you could be saved   they ll take it badly i think  you bet they will  i don t want to hurt them  but i hoped you of all people wouldn t resort to emotional blackmail  you don t have to die for your beliefs  but living without them is not living  knowing that the suffering goes on  will your actions stop it  no  but someone has to accept some responsibility for what they re doing to others  you ve decided to lift the injunction haven t you  my wishes will be ignored  i can t ignore your wishes jason i haven t heard all the arguments yet  rosie rosie come here  come here hello good dog   what s wrong  nothing  i needed to take your mind on something  i can t square the circle on this  it seemed straightforward have the boy live   yeah but you have to respect his views  he s 15 chaz  you said he meets all the legal criteria for deciding his own fate  he s not like any boy that you have ever met he s got a mind like scarman  or denning   dominated by compassion  yeah then he s capable of deciding   you re thinking like a parent dad  i am a parent  his parents love him  if he s forced to have the operation he might grow to hate them  i would  well i think what if it were you  i would want you to have the operation even if you never spoke to me again  have you thought what he might do if you let the transplant go ahead  he might stop taking the drugs then you d be back arguing about  whether to force feed them to him  for some people dad life isn t about quantity at any cost  what you can t cope with here  is someone of jason s generation making such a mature decision  i m grateful for the opportunity of meeting with jason  it doesn t make my decision any easier  i ll hear from the surgeon first and then the parents  jason is suffering from acute hypertrophic cardiomyopathy  a disease of the heart where progressive thickening of the muscles  severely restricts blood flow through the heart  we can t cure it because we don t know what causes it  what is the prognosis if he doesn t get the transplant  he will die  opinions of clinicians on this are unequivocal  this bright young 15 year old with a brilliant future ahead of him is dying  while i am prevented from doing what natural justice dictates i should do  how long will he live without the transplant  a week or two no longer than two months  because this was diagnosed late  other organs become threatened the longer we leave this decision  mr evans what would happen to jason were he to have the transplant  after about 36 hours he d resume a normal healthy life  eat normally start exercising  within a week he d do strenuous exercise and be home soon afterwards  is a new heart likely to suffer the same problems  i can t guarantee that it won t but there s a real chance it won t  meanwhile jason s body will be trying to reject the heart  we have drugs to prevent that  do you know what jason s philosophy of life is  he could live to change his mind  isn t it not to have any creature suffer for any purpose  these are purpose bred animals  according to jason s beliefs there is no difference in degrees of suffering  nor between animals and humans  jason is a romantic  i feel his views are less important than his life  how many people much less teenagers do you know  that have such a clear and resolute belief system  we are talking about a human life there s no comparison  mr evans that is your opinion  that you feel must take precedence over this teenager s deep conviction   i know what s best for the patient  is it best for jason  that s what we have to decide  jay and i have always been close  i know what he s feeling almost before him  and do you share the same affinity with either of your other two children  we re close but not in the same way  he must have this operation  it s what he really wants  he feels he can t let down his friends in the movement  what if he has the operation  and comes to hate you and your husband  i don t care  he d be alive and if he s alive then that s all that matters  mrs powell did you tell the hospital social worker that jason was going through a fad  he would change his mind he would  when did jason become vegetarian   when he was two and a half  what happened  he asked me what meat was  when you told him did he not say to you don t ever let me eat it again  mrs mills no one s asking him to  my lord this goes to the core of jason s belief system  whether a person of 15 years and 11 months  is sufficiently mature to form a view and decide for himself  it would seem that he was at two and a half  yes i m concerned that we get to a point where it s other than academic  i will try to be brief my lord but i must be thorough  yes go on  mrs powell  has jason consistently refused to eat dead animals  from the age of two and a half  it wasn t life threatening then  did those principles further develop into veganism  and a philosophy of the sanctity of all life whether human or animal  he was always very kind to animals and everyone  we were proud of him  even though he was different to other boys and he was different everybody said so  i just wanted him to be ordinary  like the other children do the things that they did  i couldn t  i couldn t bear if his being different means his dying  i couldn t  god why can t he be like other boys why can t he  thank you mrs powell  mr powell  mr evans how long will the donor heart be available to jason  a matter of days  the donor heart is deteriorating the same as jason s   at the same rate  at a similar rate  despite being on life support  there is pressure from the transplant unit my lord for a decision  yes yes i understand  i do have to resume the trial i m hearing  i am going to adjourn until 4 15 when i will hear your concluding submissions  can you tell the court how you came to charge the defendants chief inspector  the local cid had interviewed a known drug dealer hugh jenks  on an unrelated offence  he informed the officers that he d supplied lavender and dorrell with crack cocaine  in exchange for three cell phones  one of which we subsequently identified as belonging to boyd payne  the deceased boy  exhibit 2c show it to the witness  is this the phone chief inspector  yes its serial number corresponded with the phone he d purchased  two days prior to his death  did you find anything else that connected the phone with the defendants  inside the mouthpiece cover we found part of a thumbprint  that we identified as paulo dorrell s  plus there was a call that had been logged to a madeleine carter sister of dorrell   not a very clever set of thieves  drug addicts rarely are  did this drugs dealer have a previous criminal record chief inspector  yes sir three convictions for possession  two for dealing in class a drugs one for class b  on the last occasion he was arrested  i believe mr jenks was found in possession of both class a and class b drugs  yet was charged only with having the latter is that so  i work for the murder squad not the drug squad  is that yes chief inspector  yes sir  would it be reasonable to assume that a deal was done with the cps  whereby for giving evidence against the two defendants  mr jenks would be pursued on a lesser charge  it would be naive to pretend that such deals don t take place  was such a deal in place chief inspector  it s not so much a deal more of a recognition of the inevitable my lord  yes i see sir james  usually it s the absence of evidence that causes the police most problems  yet here you seem to have a situation with mr jenks  where there was such an abundance of evidence  that the police ignore the more serious class a drugs  in favour of the less serious class b  would it be unkind  to assume that through undue persuasion  mr jenks was helped to say things he might not otherwise say  that s a question for that witness surely  it just started it started for no reason  get help  do something do something  where s mr evans  what minimum number of ridges do you need on a lift  in order to make an unequivocal identification of a print  there is no longer a minimum requirement sir  i was satisfied that the unique characteristics of the print  identified it as belonging to paulo dorrell  how many ridges found were identical to the defendant s  three sir  not long ago you had to find 15   we recently changed our practice  moved the goal posts  something urgent has happened in another case i am hearing  i need to adjourn for the day this does seem to be a convenient moment  all rise  the boy s stable but the hospital don t know how long he can remain that way   all the parties present  apart from the mother judge  this is without doubt the hardest decision  that i ve ever had to arrive at in my years on the bench  in reaching it i have tried not to allow jason s deteriorating condition to have any influence  it s made doubly difficult by the fact that he s only two or three weeks away  from an age when legally he could make this decision for himself  jason impressed me with his incisive logical mind  he has great clarity of understanding  and has shown compassion and humanity about the dilemma now facing his parents  and the hospital staff  the sincerity of his position in relation to animals and animal testing  and his fervent desire to see an end to such practices  puts him way beyond his peers  it is therefore with great reluctance  that i ve decided to lift the injunction and allow doctors to make a clinical judgement  as to what is best for jason  should this decision be in favour of a transplant  i hope that he will live to be grateful for it  it is of course open for you to appeal this in the circumstances i hope that you won t  my lord with your permission we seek leave to appeal this decision   what no you can t you can t  mrs powell as disappointing as this is for you  you just said he could have the operation   the appeal can take place very soon  this isn t right   do something you re a barrister  we d appeal if it d gone the other way   what kind of evil woman are you mrs powell i understand what you must  you re all in this together nobody understands my son is gonna die  mrs powell  my son is going to die  get this heard as soon as possible  we still haven t heard anything  god what are they doing  i ve spoken to our transplant coordinator she s in touch with the donor hospital  the retrieval team are standing by to remove the heart as soon as we get word   why can t you just do it  mel you can t ask malcolm that  why not soon it s gonna be too late  i would just do it save his life  the donor hospital won t move until they hear the appeal court s decision  go home get some rest  we will get there mel i know we will  mr jenks at what point did you realise  the phone the defendants traded you for crack cocaine  was stolen from a murder victim   paulo swore on his mother s eyesight he found it  and did you believe him  are you kidding  ajunkie  how did you make the connection between this phone and the death of boyd payne  i got a visit from the clods they mentioned the killing for the phone  it was like  i weren t gonna get involved i mean  i know how bad it gets for strung outs that s why i supply them  a bit like social services are you mr jenks   supplying the needy  you could say that  yeah i bet you vote liberal too   when did you last take heroin  i don t i m in prison  but ordinarily you re a drug user  i have a dip take the edges off the day   and the mind too i venture  i don t think so  then cast your razor sharp mind back to may the 3rd  when the two detectives visited your carpet shop   what did they find  some whizz that s all  whizz  yeah whizz  yes what is it  well whizz  it s amphetamines my lord  thank you miss neil  didn t you have class a crack cocaine  a taste like not much  enough to get you sent to prison for a long while i venture  why weren t you charged with this class a drug   well i give them dwarf and paulo  a simple trade  the clods told me the kid was killed by heads out of their brains  you saw an ideal opportunity to save yourself a long prison sentence  and so you gave them the two defendants  they d have done it to me faster than light  it s a dog eat dog world mr jenks  how are you sure the phone you gave to the police  was the one the defendant supposedly gave you  i don t know i am  of the 47 stolen mobile phones the police found in your possession  you identified this one  couldn t it as easily have been any one of those the defendants gave you  they give me some of them they nick phones  you weren t charged with possessing stolen property   nope  why is that  clods was only interested in the one they killed the kid for  exhibit 2c  the motorola one  the phone boyd payne purchased two days before on may the 1 st  that s the one  the receipt that he had for the phone that he had purchased that day  was a nokia 8310  the clod said it was a motorola what was nicked  did they tell you it was stolen from the dead boy  before or after you had produced it  i don t remember  i don t think you remember very much at all do you mr jenks  mum what are you doing here  just wanted to see you  it s been a while breakfast wasn t it  i thought you had a big appeal hearing in the strand  we lost  bad  i don t think i can keep doing what i m doing mark   it takes too much out of me  we ve been there a few times mum  what would you do instead stack shelves in tesco s  how would that pay for my school fees or tom s college fees  that s what i needed a good dose of mark s common sense   are you home for supper  i don t know are you  i m going out with skywalker and the space cadet  you better catch them up  do you have any spare cash  thanks i ll catch you later  we re ready in theatre jason  no i don t want to   please  they know what s best jay  i have to believe that they do jay i know where you re coming from babe  but i can t bear the thought of you not being able to do all the things you ve only dreamt of doing  this way you ll be here to fight for the animals  no dad please don t let them i don t want it  no jason jason jason jay please jay  we love you so much jason   are you sure we re doing the right thing here  i don t want this all right   please don t

at mummy   no no  look at mummy  jay it s okay  mr bushnell  with your leave my lord  with your leave i call dr adam graceman  i wasn t the first to examine the boy  hospital doctors who tried to stop the haemorrhaging  further opened up the wounds to find the severed artery  but were you able to determine the extent of the stab wounds  i was able to form an opinion  a 10 centimetre serrated paring knife  was thrust into the lower abdomen by a short left handed man  each blow striking home to the hilt  around each puncture wound there was bruising  where the fist enclosing the hilt of the knife struck the body  would you examine exhibit 3c and say whether this was the weapon used  it was this or one exactly similar  if it might be passed to the jury to remind them that this was the knife  that the police found in the abandoned car  that was identified as being used during the robbery  how do you know the assailant was short and left handed  the victim was a little above average height for a 13 year old at one metre 69  and the wounds were low on the body  the angle traversing the appendix  into the lower intestine tells us it was left handed  equally doctor it could have been a tall right handed person attacking from behind  leaning over and stabbing the victim in an upwards thrusting motion  the calculation is based on the evidence  why a short left handed and not tall right handed person  i was asked whether a short left handed suspect could be ruled in or out  then this wasn t arrived at independently  of course it was but you have to start with a set of givens  well had you been told the assailant was 6 3 and right handed  is that how your evidence would have read   i might have formed that opinion  thank you doctor  mrs mills  let us look again at the murder weapon  if defence have no objections i should like the knife to be removed from the bag  for the purposes of a demonstration   have you sir james  no objections my lord  no objections my lord  can you tell us about the serrating  yes it has the toothed edge on the right the right hand side  if you put the knife in your left hand which side is it on  it makes no difference  can you tell us to what side of the wounds the serration tears were  on the right or the victim s left  doctor would you pretend to be a short left handed person  and stab an imaginary victim in the lower abdomen  the lower abdomen doctor  thank you doctor the serration tears are on which side  the victim s left of course  thank you doctor would you pass the knife to our tall usher please  mr usher would you hold the knife in your right hand  but with the blade towards you like this  now lean over an imaginary victim  and pretend to stab him in the lower abdomen as defence counsel suggested  would you freeze just there  the knife held in the right hand with the blade upwards  would put the serration tears on the victim s right   not his left would it not doctor  of course it would  hi this is charlie deed please leave a message  it s me i ll call you later  the sit  down protest outside kemply prison where the hunger strike by richard jones  convicted of firebombing butchers trucks is entering its 33rd day  mr jones a former medical student is protesting about the 20 year sentence  imposed by his honour judge mealy at southwark crown court doctors are  excuse me my lord mrs mills is here she doesn t appear to have an appointment  okay  if i may say so my lord she appears to be the worse for drink  ah   perhaps you could make her some coffee  my lord  mrs mills my lord  jason powell is dead he never regained consciousness after the operation  yes i know the hospital rang i m sorry  not half as sorry as you should be he died without ever waking up   did you drive like that  i m not drunk i haven t even had a drink  i could do with one or two or three  i don t care how much damage i do to my career by coming and telling the high and mighty judge  how arrogant and stupid he is  that dear caring boy  could have died with his last wish in place  he could have died at peace with his conscience and you denied him that  i know  you far exceeded both the reach of your concern and your understanding  you were unqualified and unworthy to sit in judgement of jason powell  you re no better than those arrogant surgeons you think you can play god  jason was light years ahead of you all  yes  i have to come to terms with what i did  why are you so maddeningly reasonable do something  throw me out get angry with me threaten to ruin my career but don t just  will mrs mills be wanting dinner my lord  yes that might help  you should eat something   i can t find my bag  did you arrive with one  nothing changes john  you re still an arrogant man who presumes so much  i really don t care if i ruin my career  well you ve already done that you got totally drunk  i put you to bed  and you got the reputation and none of the pleasure  pleasure  jo you did your best for the boy  i i  i try to be very relaxed on my circuit  i endeavour to exercise judgement concerning the behaviour of judges  but we do have a standard to keep up john  it s important that we re seen to behave properly  what are you talking about michael  you don t make this easy  there are rumours that you have barristers who are before you in your room  now i can ignore gossip but i ve just seen mrs mills  in no fit state to drive  we did have one or two last night  this does create a problem with the lord chancellor s department  sir ian rochester believes that you are having an affair with mrs mills  well he s wrong michael  whatever happened in your rooms with mrs mills the staff now believe that you re lovers  they also know that she is before you in court  it was wholly innocent end of story  did i get it wrong about that transplant chaz  you re only spider man dad not god  as judges we re supposed to be right  the judges weren t right about richard jones you want them to be wise infallible  but well they re from the same planet as everyone else  could you stick around for lunch  a group of us are going down to kemply prison to look at the vigil  don t get into any trouble seriously  it s enough that one of us has a big fat file at the lord chancellor s department   do you want some money  i m a student dad  i certainly didn t envy you that decision john either way the boy lost  had he lived he d have probably changed his mind  i believe he was ready to die for his principles  at that age everything s a matter of life and death  what about this hunger striker  i thought this was about jo mills   are you seeing her again  who knows  going out with her is a bit like having you around  oh dear  the evidence against the hunger striker in kemply was sound  oh they didn t catch him burning the meat trucks or find him with the incendiary devices  though there were candles and firelighters and matches at his house  he got 20 years row  you know conspiracy charges they re a necessary evil  you can t always catch these people at it doesn t mean to say they didn t do it  my doubts are increasing  it s reckoned there s seven million pounds worth of property damage at this lad s door   this could cost him his life  and the lives he put at risk  if he did it  charlie thinks that he ll die before he backs down  you were just now complaining that you didn t let a young man die for his principles  seems peaceful enough stephen  for now judge  it may not stay like that if the hunger striker s condition gets any worse  the protesters will get bored or the police will  did you see charlie there sir  let s go i mustn t keep you from home any longer   john this is a surprise  i came to see your father  still have dinner on wednesdays  we might give back gibraltar we might even adopt the euro  but wednesdays wouldn t be wednesdays without daddy  he s on the terrace smoking  a re examination of the evidence joe it s not much to ask  the court of appeal looked at the boy s case  i ve given an indication that i intend to rule against the appeal   twenty years is an appropriate sentence  one year would be unjust if he s innocent  there s nothing to suggest that charlie is right simply because she s young  or that this firebomber is innocent simply because he is refusing prison food  he s not simply refusing prison food he s starving himself to death  have you paused with your bleeding heart  to consider that the man might just be bloody minded  i m becoming convinced he s right  i repeat we reviewed the evidence it was sound  i wish i could be as certain in my judgements  if you can t you have no business sitting in the high court  oh dear that sounds like fighting talk i thought perhaps you two could become friends  on what might we base that friendship  i had to try joe for charlie s sake  charlie came to me with some foolish argument  that the trial judge may have been influenced by the media   which is a possibility  it can t happen we don t have trial by media  let s calm down and have dinner shall we you ll stay john   no i ve decided to go to my club  no no   sorry if it inconveniences you  i can t stay anyway   don t be ridiculous the food s ready  my mind is made up  george  daddy  well you ll have to stay now  how s your cabinet minister  i ve had more fun with a church minister  oops  i can t stay jo mills is in a bit of a state   i want to make sure she s all right  oh  poor little miss oxfam  hi this is charlie deed please leave a message  hi chaz it s me i spoke to your grandad he s completely intractable  so do some work on the trial by media angle call me soon   hello  jo it s john  which john is that  you only know one john  what is it you want john   i m concerned about you i d like to come round  i m tired i m in bed  someone at the door i have to go   you normally go to bed like that  seems i do  did it occur to you that i might feel as badly as you do about jason powell  you have a remarkable facility for hiding it  there was never any question in my mind but that he should live  he had principles that he was prepared to die for but  he told me you know he told me i d find in favour of the transplant  he begged me not to he begged me not to lift the injunction  so  i told him i hadn t made up my mind and he saw right through it  saw the lie  i thought i could save him  he was such  such an extraordinary young man  i betrayed him  why is it that i always end up feeling concerned about you   why is that  you don t need to  did it occur to you why it was me that came for the injunction  when the solicitor for the guardian ad litem asked me to help  i said yes hoping that you would be on call  i thought i would easily persuade you of my views  he nearly got michael nivan  regrettably john deed has lost my confidence ian  oh you were always one of his staunchest supporters michael  yes i ve argued his corner in the past on principle  i was mistaken  not many admit their mistakes nowadays much less apologise  that leaves the question of what to do about him  as long as you don t send him to a court that i m next due at  what has caused this loss of confidence  i must get back the lord chancellor will be missing me  lan  i believe that john deed lied to me about his having relations with mrs mills  there s little one can do to deed in the circumstances  however i know exactly the sanction one can employ against mrs mills  she may yet prove to be his achilles heel  with your leave my lord i would like to call brian payne the dead boy s father  my lord i cannot even begin to imagine how mr payne can be a material witness  to the events that happened to his son  i believe he was at work some 20 miles away at the time  i m at a loss mrs mills  neither of my learned colleagues raised any objections at the pre trial review my lord  why didn t you object earlier the witness was on the list   it seemed indelicate something changed   i have no objections  mr brandy  i have none either  he wanted a mobile phone ever since he was a young kid  he was never really into toys unless they were electronic  but we resisted letting him have a phone and then we run out of arguments  ironically kids on their own and getting into difficulties was what persuaded us  but we made him save up and pay for it himself  he worked weekends doing gardening jobs for the neighbours  he pestered them to let him clean their cars  it seemed to take him no time at all to get the 109 together  he didn t stop until he had enough money to buy it  what sort of phone did he purchase mr payne  he wanted the motorola wap  but i persuaded him to get the nokia  but he wasn t happy with it and he took it back to the shop the next day  and he switched it for the one he wanted  the motorola   the shop let him switch like that  they have a cooling off period  when your son took the first phone back did they give him a new receipt  no there was a slight difference in price but he took a spare cover for it  so the receipt we have here showing a nokia being purchased is the only receipt there is  yes i  i shouldn t have tried to argue it out of him  he knew exactly what he wanted  he knew exactly what he wanted  there wasn t a function on that phone he couldn t run backwards in the dark  oh god i miss him i really miss that boy  look at you  you re not much older than boyd was  i don t know if you did this  but whatever happens whatever the outcome  nothing will bring him back  and nothing will undo what has been done to our family  i would hate to see any more lives destroyed by this senseless act  i m sorry  thank you mr payne  sir james  i have no questions  mr brandy  your honour  thank you mr payne you can step down now  that was my last witness and concludes the case for the crown my lord  thank you mrs mills  doesn t your heart just break for that poor father  yes  does make you wonder how they managed to carry on  mrs powell rang judge jason s funeral is on thursday at 11 oo  anarchists joining the silent vigil began hurling stones at the police  three of whom were injured  a number of protesters were also injured two seriously  richard jones the animal rights activist is on the 37th day of his hunger strike  doctors are now concerned for his life  a hospital spokesman said if he survives   he could be blind and suffer serious liver impairment  workers at  hi this is charlie deed please leave a message  chaz it s me i hope you re at college and not at kemply prison call me  this had better be good   it s john  oh i thought it was neil   have you heard from our daughter  should i have done   it s late i can t get her  she s 21  at that age the evening s just beginning  yes you re probably right  this is not really about charlie  john  have you given that drip of a cabinet minister the elbow yet  good night john  what is this john a wake up call  i need a favour i think charlie was in the riot at kemply and i can t get her  can you find out anything  well it s not the most convenient hour to get information  the rioters could be dispersed anywhere i ll call you back  thanks row  what are your feelings rosie   any messages coop  only mrs channing judge  wanting to know if you ve heard from charlie   hello john  there were 39 arrests none were bailed because all gave their name as a smith  there are 24 miss smiths  they were taken to the magistrates court this morning  was everyone arrested  well all bar four demonstrators they were injured and taken to hospital  two were kept in look i ll call you as soon as they re identified okay  yep thanks row   are they ready coop  they re all in judge  mr dorrell  i m sure by now the 1 st of may is a day seared into your mind  would you tell us how the day started   woke up  yes  where  at dwarf s squat  he was looking after it for someone  we woke up late i was strung i needed something  there was nothing in the house  no booze not even a cigarette i went upstairs and borrowed something from a neighbour   a neighbour you knew  no  i told her that i had a job interview  that s why my hands were shaking she gave me two valium i injected them  dwarf went crazy he didn t get nothing  so we went out looking for something to nick to get us something to get us on  and then we saw this kid with a mobile phone not the one we killed  i mean we re supposed to have killed not that kid  we never met him did we dwarf it was a black kid  we got three phones from the black kids one from a woman s bag  and i don t know where we got the other one  the man said they weren t worth nothing  the man being hugh jenks the dealer  he said go and get some more if we wanted a good hit  did he give you anything for the phones  some crack  what did you do after you got the drugs  we went back to the flop and got it on  having got it on what did you do  we were gone man out of it   where did you get the car you were driving  we didn t have no car that day did we dwarf  your fingerprints and those of david lavender were found in a car  stolen from sainsbury s car park at 14 15 two hours before boyd payne was killed  well you saw the video footage from the security camera earlier in evidence   would you like to see it again  i thought that was another day  what were you doing during those two hours before you saw boyd payne  it wasn t me that saw him  i mean we were getting phones from the black kid  one phone plus one from the woman s bag that makes two  you traded three phones with hugh jenks jenks says that one of them was boyd payne s phone   was he mistaken  he must be  who saw boyd first you or dwarf   dwarf can spot an easy mark  but he wasn t such an easy mark was he  he fought back did you expect that  not many fight back  you show them the blade that s it   whose idea was it to carry a blade  dwarf always carries a blade  someone always tries to steal your score  before you answer this next question i want you to think very very hard about it  when you shouted give it to him dwarf let him have it before we re nicked  do you mean the phone that the boy was struggling to keep  or did give it to him mean  stab him with the blade  this is important mr dorrell very important  what was the question again  when you shouted give it to him dwarf let him have it before we re nicked  i just wanted to get going  i mean i had something but dwarf was so strung he was going crazy he was  he needed something he wasn t gonna let it go for nothing  i just wanted to get out of there but dwarf wasn t gonna give it up  we knew we weren t gonna get nothing for the rubbish that we d already got so  but i didn t care  i didn t know he was gonna stab him dwarf just went crazy  thank you mr dorrell  this does seem to be a convenient moment  all rise   where is she  she s not been positively identified  none of the prison protestors have a girl answering charlie s description was injured   she s unconscious  where  erith hospital  and there s no identification  none of the protestors have broken ranks to identify anyone  coop call charlie s mother tell her i m on my way thanks row  is there any more news  the hospital don t seem to know very much  i m waiting for daddy he s coming too  i m sure it s not as bad as it sounds  why does she always get involved  i ll see you there  oh mr deed i m sister lee the young lady s gone for an mri  is this her  it looks like her  are you sure  the face is swollen there seems to be brain damage  can i see her   we sent her to dartford hospital for the mri  okay   she ll be about two hours  i ll go there   they ll be very busy i ll come and tell you  no no i ll go there please tell them   george where are you  in a taxi 30 minutes away  they ve taken her to dartford hospital now for a brain scan   oh this is too awful what is it  is it charlie  i haven t seen her yet  i ll see you in dartford  john   still no news  someone must know something   i ve asked every ten seconds  who s in charge   there s a nurse somewhere  is there a doctor on duty a consultant   are you in charge  are you mrs deed   tell me what s happening to my daughter  we d best wait for the doctor   no tell me what is it tell me  i m sorry  i m sorry she died during the mri  she arrested and they couldn t resuscitate her   don t be ridiculous mri doesn t kill anyone  was she positively identified   the doctor is on his way  why isn t he here   yeah what s going on  daddy  i blame you for this your emotional incontinence your lack of parental authority  you shouldn t have let her get involved in such protests  where is she i want to see her  she d have been taken to the mortuary  it s not her  it s not her  thank god  it s somebody s child joe  yeah i know  some wretched parent will have to go through what we ve been through  i m sorry i don t know her i m sorry   hi dad just picked up your messages  charlie you  stupid stupid girl  you re fortunate no one on the protest was identified  yeah well the police stopped trying to get our names after caroline denning died   they re afraid of the consequences  what are you saying chaz  they conveniently haven t got any witnesses to the protestor s death  do you have proof of that  well at least your name won t appear on any of the lord chancellor s files  to blight your career as a lawyer  don t think i want to be a lawyer any more dad  what s happening to richard jones has made me realise  that it s so often about lying and obfuscation   it can be about truth and justice  yeah well too often it just masks justice  ordinary caring people never even coming close to it  that s what s happened to richard he will die for want of justice and no one cares   caroline died and no one cares  you care chaz   sometimes one person is all it takes  yeah but nothing changes dad  nothing ever will if people like you quit  a few good people can make a difference don t give up on your hunger striker chaz  right now you re all he s got  just how much time do you think i have to waste on this case  i gave what i thought was an unequivocal answer  this man is going to die unless somebody prevents it  the remedy is in his own hands  he s a man of principle who argues that he is innocent of this crime   yeah i m glad you said this crime  and it s the only one for which he s been tried  joe you were recently given back your granddaughter whom you presumed dead   all thanks to this hunger striker  she made a principled stand for justice  now she s thinking of giving up the law because of its remoteness to justice   yes that would be most regrettable  joe  you got her back  give somebody else their son back  emotional poppycock  before we commit this dearly loved young man into god s care  i d like to take a moment for anyone who wishes to remember jason  perhaps in some personal way or to read a favourite poem  sometimes emotion is best expressed in silence  um  you all knew jason better than i did  there is a poem  that i was sent when my mother died i was just a bit younger than jason  do not stand at my grave and weep  i am not there  i do not sleep  i am a thousand winds that blow  i am the diamond glints on snow  i am the sun on ripened grain  i am the gentle autumn rain  when you awaken in the morning hush  i am the swift uplifting rush  of quiet birds in circle flight  i am the soft stars that shine at night  do not stand at my grave and cry  i m not there  i did not die  someone has to accept some responsibility for what we re doing to others  this animal rights hunger strike is causing the government a great deal of concern joe  yeah it s hard to read this government from one day to the next  their concern is he might die  well that s his object to bring undue pressure to bear  democracy cannot accede to emotional blackmail  the chancellor s keen to show the law with a more human face   even if that face distorts justice  heaven forbid joe  justice tempered with compassion could provide a neat exit from the political impasse  it could only be done if somehow the case were found to be unsound  unsound  i was hoping to find an honourable compromise  well that s no bad thing nothing functions well from the extremes  my sentiments entirely no matter  shame about the death of lord ramsey of howell   he seemed one those indestructible types  yeah  law lord for eight years still  we must canvas for a replacement  dominic oh dominic  i ve been re reading the evidence in the case of that hunger striker  i am less of the opinion that we are right  well i m surprised joe you were the most convinced of all three of us  yes well before we give our ruling do you think we might have a further conversation about it  yes of course my dear fellow yes of course  mrs mills   could i have a word  well if it s brief sir ian i have a con  the briefest of exchanges is all that s necessary  i ll catch you outside  it s come to the lord chancellor s attention that you recently stayed the night  in mr justice deed s room at his lodgings  i m surprised the lord chancellor concerns himself sir ian  we take particular interest in her majesty s counsel  whom we advise the sovereign to appoint  especially where they are having carnal knowledge with high court judges  and such acts take place on crown property  most especially when the qc in question is before the judge in question  you pursued his lordship with a similar false accusation have you learned nothing  we re civil servants mrs mills we rarely learn from past experience  not even when it s germane to the present situation which we don t believe this is  it s not his lordship we re concerned about  your professional body could hardly regard your conduct becoming  worse than a doctor and his patient in a way  even if there were anything it would be a private matter between two consenting adults  adult you may be and indeed consenting  but there s no such thing as a private life when it concerns a high court judge  however one could always retire  rather than face the embarrassment of a disciplinary hearing  i ve worked very hard to get where i am  i hope to be a judge one day   joe they can t be serious  they re deadly serious  they wouldn t dare to take it any further  the only damage likely to result will already have been done an entry in the secret file  you ve heard all the arguments  a loving son was snatched from his parents whose lives were to implode as a result  now you may think that these two defendants are wastrels  you know by their own admission that they re thieves  who stole to feed this tragic addiction which so blights their lives  you have to decide if they are murderers  now in order to find them guilty of murder or even of manslaughter  then you must be certain beyond any reasonable doubt  if you have any doubts then they must be reflected in your verdict  and that verdict must be unanimous unless i instruct you otherwise  now don t feel that you re under any pressure to arrive at a quick verdict  if your sensible deliberations don t give us a verdict today  then you may be able to do so tomorrow  so go away now and carefully consider your verdict  richard jones who was sentenced to 20 years for alleged firebombing  was close to death when by unanimous verdict  three appeal judges ruled the sentence was unsafe  lord channing said on announcing the judgement   that while mr jones was a prime mover in the animal liberation front  the evidence was insufficient to sustain the conviction   hi dad  charlie i m just watching it  isn t it fantastic it s brilliant  the old boy has blood in his veins after all  should i call grandad and thank him  well of course you should call him every day he s your grandad  charlie somebody still firebombed those lorries somebody broke the law  in the case of the first defendant paulo dorrell  on the charge of murder do you find him guilty or not guilty  not guilty  in the alternative of manslaughter do you find the defendant guilty or not guilty  guilty  in the case of the second defendant david lavender  on the charge of murder do you find him guilty or not guilty  not guilty  in the alternative of manslaughter do you find the defendant guilty or not guilty  guilty  you find both defendants not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter in the alternative  you re not required to account for your reasons but i m sure the court is curious  can we add an observation about the need for a degree of mercy  it s not encouraged nowadays but i ll hear your recommendation yes  we ve seen these two men give totally confused and contradictory evidence  we know they killed boyd payne  but we felt that as they were lost in a world of drugs  they were no longer responsible for their actions  they lacked true responsibility  well  i see  i won t be asking for further pre sentence reports  i already have probation reports drug rehab reports psychiatric reports  the only thing i haven t got on these two is a financial report  we already know that their lacking the means to support their wretched drug habit  lead them to take the life of a young man who had everything to live for  paulo dorrell and david lavender  you are without any discernable remorse  for the destruction that you have wrought in the lives of the paynes  it s clear from his testimony that brian payne is a man with space in his heart for forgiveness  so you can be grateful that at least you don t have to bear hatred and enmity from him  there is a forgiving god of that i am convinced  and if it were in my power i would compel you to spend every day of the sentence  i am about to give you on your knees begging for forgiveness  should you as a result ever experience true remorse  you may come to feel that it would be better had you not been born  than to take the life of this little one  all that might have been decent about you was leeched away through drug use  and for that you are to be pitied  but manslaughter is what you ve been found guilty of  and manslaughter gives me the broadest scope for sentencing  you will therefore each go to prison for 25 years  that is a sentence which by its very severity could be appealed  however i have every confidence in the common sense of the appeal court judges  who i m sure will uphold this sentence  take them down  yes  did i wake you   oh i wish  are you free later  just as soon as i ve sentenced my commuter vigilante i am yeah  i ll find you  all reports i have on you mr ryder suggest that you are a pillar of society  someone who takes the responsibilities of citizenship very seriously  the problem we have is your tendency to take the law into your own hands  this tendency led to the death of a young mugger on brighton station  after you had intentionally put temptation in his way  there are many bad people around mr ryder  and fewer and fewer citizens prepared to have a go  and i accept that it was not your intention that he should die  but he did as a result of your precipitous action  such an act cannot go unpunished  having been found guilty of manslaughter you will go to prison for two years  i could suspend this but i m not going to  instead i m going to recommend to the home secretary  that he starts a support release scheme  because too many people are languishing pointlessly in prison  please please  to qualify you will need to find three people  not related to you who are prepared to support you and guide you in the community  to secure your release from prison  i m sure that any number of these people would be prepared to support you in such a scheme  i m equally sure that the home secretary will adopt it  take him down  i received a letter from the lord chancellor s department this morning  i ll bet that does you no good  they re referring the question of my relationship with you whilst appearing before you  to the professional conduct committee of the bar council  then you ll need a good lawyer   or a good witness  listen john you don t understand  we will not only fight this we ll comminute these people in the process   it s not me they want john  me they can have on a platter  or my bones ground up before i ll let them even touch you   i won t let you do that  you won t have any choice  how could they possibly think that they were going to get away with this  even if they had any evidence  they don t  do they  john i may have got drunk but i wasn t that drunk  john come here come here don t i can t run i m wearing heels  '"

on hurry up  Okay good Now back up  Back up Just back up  Get outta my way  Any of you ever hear  about the guy who invented nitroglycerin  Probably not  because he blew his freaking face off  His lab assistant came into the room  saw that his mentor had detonated  and he said Huh  I guess this stuff does work  We re not gonna take more of this stuff than we need  because nitroglycerine is extremely temperamental  So we just  Dude  Ahhh   Sorry for the inconvenience  I m sure you are  Sir your bag was unattended   Am I free to go  Yes sir  Good  I have a plane to catch  Could you hand

Because I know where she s going   Please now  I want my baby  I can carry all the sticks in my pack  The more insulation we stuff in the better  I think we should split em up  What  It s not smart to keep it all together so we split em up  If we need three sticks to blow the hinge  then we should bring six  Three and three  A fail safe In case one of us  You and me then  No I m taking one  Not

Rousseau told us she saw black smoke  the day her own child was taken 16 years ago  They took something from her  And now she believes she has something they want   She s making a trade  I believe she

sometimes Jack   Because you re a man of science  Yeah   And what does that make you  Me  Well I m a man of faith  Do you really think all this is an accident  That we a group of strangers survived  Many of us with just superficial injuries  You think we crashed on this place by coincidence Especially this place  We were brought here for a purpose For a reason All of us  Each one of us was brought here for a reason  Brought here  And who brought us here John  The island  The island brought us here  This is no ordinary place You ve seen that I know you have  The island chose you too Jack  It s destiny  Did you talk with Boone about destiny John  Boone was a sacrifice that the island demanded  What happened to him at that plane was a part of a chain of events  that led us here that led us down a path  that led you and me to this day to right now  And where s that path end John  The path ends at the hatch  The hatch Jack All of it All of it happened so we can open the hatch  No No we re opening the hatch so that we can survive  Survival is all relative Jack  I don t believe in destiny  Yes you do  You just don t know it yet   I turned it on a little while ago  Sayid said every
